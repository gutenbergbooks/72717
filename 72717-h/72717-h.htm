<p>Most Books have to have an Excuse by some
one for the Author, but this is the only Book ever
written that has to have an Alibi for the Title, too.
About 4 years ago, out in California, I was writing
sayings for the Screen and I called it the Illiterate
Digest. Well one day up bobs the following letter
from this N. Y. Lawyer. It and the answer are
absolutely just as they were exchanged at that time.</p>

<p>Will Rogers, Esq.,<br>
c/o Goldwyn Studios,<br>
Culver City, Calif.</p>

<p><i>Dear Sir</i>:—
</p>

<p><i>My client, the Funk &amp; Wagnalls Company, publishers
of the “Literary Digest” have requested me<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</span>
to write to you in regard to your use of the phrase,
“The Illiterate Digest,” as a title to a moving picture
subject gotten up by you, the consequence of
which may have escaped your consideration.</i></p>

<p><i>For more than two years past it (my client) has
placed upon the moving picture screen a short reel
subject carrying the title “Topics of the Day” selected
from the Press of the World by “The Literary
Digest.” This subject has achieved a wide popularity
both because of the character and renown of
“The Literary Digest” and through the expenditure
of much time, effort and money by its owners in
presenting the subject to the public. “The Literary
Digest” is a publication nearly thirty years old, and
from a small beginning has become probably the
most influential weekly publication in the world. Its
name and the phrase “Topics of the Day” are fully
covered by usage as trademarks as well as by registration
as such in the United States Patent Office.</i></p>

<p><i>During several months past your “title,” “The
Illiterate Digest” has been repeatedly called to our
attention and we are told that the prestige of “The
Literary Digest” is being lowered by the subject
matter of your film as well as by the title of your
film because the public naturally confuse the two
subjects. We are also told that exhibitors are being
misled by the similarity of titles and that some of
them install your subject in the expectation that they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</span>
are securing “The Literary Digest Topics of the
Day.”</i></p>

<p><i>It seems to me self-evident that your title would
scarcely have been thought of or adopted had it not
been for our magazine and for our film. If this
were not the case the title which you use would be
without significance to the general public.</i></p>

<p><i>I have advised the publishers that they may proceed
against you through the Federal Trade Commission
in Washington calling upon you to there
defend yourself against the charge of “unfair competition,”
because of your simulation of their title, or
that they can proceed against you, the producers of
your film, its distributors and exhibitors in court for
an injunction restraining you from use of the title,
“The Illiterate Digest.”</i></p>

<p><i>Before, however, instituting any proceedings in
either direction they have suggested that I write directly
to you to see if your sense of fairness will not
cause you to voluntarily withdraw the use of the
objectionable title.</i></p>

<p><i>Unless I hear favorably from you on or before
the first of December, I shall conclude that you are
not willing to accede to this suggestion and will take
such steps as I may deem advisable.</i></p>

<i>Yours truly</i>,</p>

</p>

<p>
<span class="smcap">Mr Wm Beverly Winslow</span>,<br>
<br>
<i>Dear Sir</i>,<br>
</p>

<p><i>Your letter in regard to my competition with the
Literary Digest received and I never felt as swelled
up in my life, And am glad you wrote directly to
me instead of communicating with my Lawyers, As
I have not yet reached that stage of prominence
where I was commiting unlawful acts and requireing
a Lawyer, Now if the Literary Digest feels that
the competition is to keen for them—to show you
my good sportsmanship I will withdraw, In fact I
had already quit as the gentlemen who put it out
were behind in their payments and my humor kinder
waned, in fact after a few weeks of no payments I
couldent think of a single joke. And now I want to
inform you truly that this is the first that I knew
my Title of the Illiterate Digest was an infringement
on yours as they mean the direct opposite, If a
magazine was published called Yes and another Bird
put one out called No I suppose he would be infringeing.
But you are a Lawyer and its your business
to change the meaning of words, so I lose
before I start,</i></p>

<p><i>Now I have not written for these people in months
and they havent put any gags out unless it is some
of the old ones still playing. If they are using gags<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</span>
that I wrote on topical things 6 months ago then
I must admit that they would be in competition
with the ones the Literary Digest Screen uses now.
I will gladly furnish you with their address, in
case you want to enter suit, And as I have no
Lawyer you can take my case too and whatever we
get out of them we will split at the usual Lawyer
rates of 80-20, the client of course getting the 20,</i></p>

<p><i>Now you inform your Editors at once that their
most dangerous rival has withdrawn, and that they
can go ahead and resume publication, But you inform
Your clients that if they ever take up Rope
Throwing or chewing gum that I will consider it a
direct infringement of my rights and will protect it
with one of the best Kosher Lawyers in Oklahoma,</i></p>

<p><i>Your letter to me telling me I was in competition
with the Digest would be just like Harding writing
to Cox and telling him he took some of his votes,</i></p>

<p><i>So long Beverly if you ever come to California,
come out to Beverly where I live and see me</i></p>

<p class="author">
<i>Illiterately yours</i><br>
<span class="smcap">Will Rogers</span>.<br>

<p>When I sent him my answer I read it to some
of the Movie Company I was working with at the
time and they kept asking me afterwards if I had
received an answer. I did not, and I just thought, oh
well, there I go and waste a letter on some High<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</span>
Brow Lawyer with no sense of humor. I was sore
at myself for writing it. About 6 months later I
came back to join the Follies and who should come
to call on me but the nicest old Gentleman I had
ever met, especially in the law profession. He was
the one I had written the letter to, and he had
had Photographic Copies made of my letter and
had given them around to all his Lawyer friends.</p>

<p>So it is to him and his sense of humor, that I dedicate
this Volume of deep thought. I might also
state that the Literary Digest was broad-minded
enough to realize that there was room for both,
and I want to thank them for allowing me to announce
my Illiteracy publicly.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="INTRODUCTION">INTRODUCTION</h2>
</div>


<p>This book should have been long before now on
the Bookshelves of every reader of worth while
Literature in the English speaking World, in addition
to being well worn in our best reference Libraries,
and should have been already translated
into every known and unknown tongue. What you
will immediately ask delayed such an important
event? Well the principal reason is it had not been
written, and the next is We had no introduction
for it. You let a Book go out without an Alibi
by some other writer, and it is practically a commercial
suicide. When the Publishers were all clamoring
for a Book from me, and were practically
annihilating (Boy there is a word I never used
before in my life and I hope it fits in, I read it
in some War Novel) each other for the Publishing
rights and assured profits, they of course felt that
through my wide Literary acquaintance, gained during
years of association at the Democratic National
Convention, and the late World Series with some<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</span>
of the best contemporary Writers of modern times,
I should through my Literary standing and personal
friendship, allow some of them to have the honor
of penning the introduction to this Time Table of
National Catastrophes.</p>

<p>William Emporia Allen White was my first
thought, on account of his having a middle name,
which always sounds Literary, even if its owner is
not. Then I had heard he himself had written a
Book once, and by now should know what Introductions
should not be. Then he went home and
announced himself as a Candidate for Governor. So
that eliminated him from my thoughts. To have a
big broad-minded book have any narrow Political
endorsement would mean certain calamity among
people who think. To run for Governor is bad
enough, But to run for Governor of Kansas and
then write an Introduction of my worthy efforts,
would simply make the book a laughing stock.</p>

<p>Then my thoughts turned to Arthur Brisbane, I
don’t know what I could have been eating that my
thoughts should have done such a mental somersault.
But I guess it was because I had known
Arthur for years,—I knew him before William
Randolph Hearst started working for him. I approached<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</span>
him on it, and he said, Sorry Will but
what I write must point a moral, there must be a
lesson in every paragraph; mine must not only be
news but it must be instructive news. For instance,
I read China will not go to war on rainy days.
What does that bit of news mean to the individual
that dont think? Nothing! What does it mean to
me? It means that a Chinaman would rather get
shot than wet. It points a moral to peace: Have
all so-called civilized Nations stop wars on rainy
days. Then hold all wars in Portland, Oregon where
it rains every day, and you will eliminate Wars and
have universal Peace.</p>

<p>So he could see no particular Moral in writing
an Introduction to my book, unless it was that Books
should not depend entirely on their introductions as
they do now. So I next thought of my friend Irvin
Cobb. I had set next to him at so many Speakers
Tables, at banquets, and had always given him any
little extras that I might not want. Ice Cream and
Sweets and things like that he just loves and ruins
them at a Banquet. Well he was going Duck shooting
down in Louisiana and said he wouldn’t miss
one Duck for the pleasure of writing the Introduction
to the Encyclopedia Brittanica. So you just let the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</span>
old fat thing try to get my Ice Cream at another
Banquet.</p>

<p>Of course Ring Lardner was one of my very first
thoughts, because I knew he could add the little
touch of comedy that the book really needed. I
went to him and told him that I only wanted something
light and airy, maybe just one good joke would
do the trick and take away from the serious nature
of the Book. He is not only a Humorist but has got
plenty money to show that he is. He said before
he shook hands with me, What is there in it? I
said well this is just a kind of an honorary thing,
a kind of courtesy from one Author to another.
He then asked me why should he give me a joke
for nothing? He could put the joke into his Sunday
Newspaper Article; then he could put the joke into
his weekly Newspaper Cartoon; then he could sell it
to a Musical Comedy and they would tell it so bad
it would sound new. Then the Movies would buy
it and make a drama out of it; then he would
still hold the Phonograph, and broadcasting rights,
and after it got well enough known write a Song
around it. So he said I would be a fine egg to give
you a joke for nothing.</p>

<p>I wish that Spaniard Ibanez, that wrote the 4<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</span>
Horsemen was over here, I know him well, I had
read 5 or 6 of his Books and I was to a big reception
given to him in Los Angeles, and during our conversations
through an Interpreter he learned I had
read so many of his Books. No one else he met
there even among the Literary ones had ever read
any but the 4 Horsemen, So when he went home
he sent me an Autographed Copy which read “To
an American Cowboy, the only person in America
I found who had read all my Books.” The funny
thing about it is that he is the only Author I ever
read. Now if he was here he would write me an
Introduction, But of course it would be in Spanish
and nobody could read it, so I would be just as bad
off as I am now.</p>

<p>I also know Elinor Glyn, I met her when she
was out in California looking around for some one
to cast as Paul in “Three Weeks.” She sent for me
but I had just started on another new Picture. She
could have cooked me up a hot Introduction. She
would have draped the first few paragraphs with
Tiger skins, and described me in such a way that
I would have really looked like something. So I
just says to myself, why monkey with these writers,
why not write my own Introduction? So here goes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</span></p>

<p>I have known Mr. Rogers for years and have
long been familiar with his Literary masterpieces,
both in Novels, and in Books of technical knowledge.
I think there are few writers of Poetry or prose today
who equal him, and I am certain he is surpassed
by none.</p>

<p>I say this because I have lived and known the life
he has pictured so well in this Book; I spent my late
youth in these shaded oak lands where so many of
his scenes are so pictorially laid, and he has made
me live over again the scenes of my freshman manhood.
No writer since the days of Remington can
give you such a word picture of the west. That’s
because he is a westerner himself, and has only an
eye for the beautiful things as he and nature alone
can describe them. He alone of all our modern
writers knows the people of which they write. When
he describes a Corset you can feel it pinch. If it’s
a Sunrise he describes, you reach for an Umbrella.
His jugglery of correct words and perfect English
sentences is magical, and his spelling is almost uncanny.</p>

<p>The words, <i>Illiterate Digest</i>, which appear upon
the title page of this book, has been generally compared
to Don Quixote and to the Pickwick Papers,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</span>
while E. M. Vogue places its author somewhere
between Cervantes and LeSage. However, considerable
the influence of Cervantes and Dickens may
have been, the first in the matter of structure, the
other in background, humor, and detail of characterization,
the predominating and distinguishing
quality of this Author’s work is undeniably foreign
to both and quite peculiar to itself. Something that
for want of a better term might be called the quality
of American Soul, any reader familiar as I know
you all to be with the works of Dostoieffsky, Turgenev,
or even Tolstoi, will grasp the deeper meaning
of a work like this. Some consider the Author a
realist, who has drawn with meticulous detail a picture
of contemporary life, others more observing see
in him a great symbolist.</p>

<p>He always remembers that it is dangerous to jest
with laughter. This man in writing this has done
a service to all thinking mankind. It is a revelation,
as an omen of a freer future. Belinsky, the great
Russian Critic to whom Mr. Rogers had read the
manuscript, said “it looked like another Ben Hur
to him.”</p>

<p>So now Mr. Cobb, and Mr. Lardner, and all you
introduction writers, what do I want with you?<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</span>
There is not a one of you could have said the things
of me that I have said, because you Guys dont know
what books to look in to get all that big league stuff
out of,</p>

<p class="author">
Yours for Arts sake,<br>
<br>
<span class="smcap">William Penn Adair Rogers</span></p>

<p class="center">(<i>boy that is my real name, let some Literary Guy<br>
top that</i>)
</p>

<p>P. S. I got enough Introduction left over to
write another Introduction if I had anything to write
another book about.</p>

</div>


<p>Everybody is writing something nowadays.
It used to be just the Literary or Newspaper
men who were supposed to know what
they were writing about that did all the writing.
But nowadays all a man goes into office for is so
he can try to find out something and then write it
when he comes out.</p>

<p>Now being in Ziegfeld Follies for almost a solid
year in New York has given me an inside track on
some of our biggest men in this country who I meet
nightly at the stage door.</p>

<p>So I am breaking out in a rash here. I will cite
an example to prove to you what you are going to
get. Not long ago there was a mess of Governors
here from various Provinces. And a good friend of
mine brought back to the stage and dressing room
Governor Allen of Kansas. Well, I stood him in the
wings and he was supposed to be looking at my act,
but he wasn’t. He was watching what really is the
Backbone of our Show. He anyway heard some of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</span>
my Gags about our Government and all who are
elected to help missrun it.</p>

<p>So at the finish of my act I dragged him out on
the stage and introduced him to the audience. He
made a mighty pretty little speech and said he enjoyed
Will’s Impertinences, and got a big laugh on
that. Said I was the only man in America who was
able to tell the truth about our Men and Affairs.</p>

<p>When he finished I explained to the audience why
I was able to tell the truth. It is because I have
never mixed up in Politics. So you all are going
from time to time to get the real Low Down on
some of those Birds who are sending home the
Radish Seed.</p>

<p>You know the more you read and observe about
this Politics thing, you got to admit that each party
is worse than the other. The one that’s out always
looks the best. My only solution would be to keep
’em both out one term and hire my good friend
Henry Ford to run the whole thing and give him a
commission on what he saves us. Put his factory in
with the government and instead of Seeds every
spring mail out those Things of his.</p>

<p>Mail Newberry one every morning Special Delivery.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</span></p>

<p>Speaking of Henry Ford, I see where Uncle
Henry has a new Rule in force out in his Factory
where they paste those Knick Knacks together.
Every man working there has to have his breath
smelled every morning. That, of course, seems like
a pretty strict Rule to put in force in a So called
Free Country, and it has come in for a lot of criticism
in the papers, but the way I look at it, it is absolutely
necessary. Should a man go to work in there who
had had a few strong shots of some of our National
Drinks of today, he would blow his breath on one
of those FOB’S, and blow all the bolts right out of
it.</p>

<p>Now Mr. Ford is a very smart man and in passing
these rigid rules I bet you he knows where to
stop. I bet you that he won’t instruct his Salesmen
to be so strict with a Purchaser. In fact his salesmen
smell of your breath when you come in to buy one
and if it shows no signs of drink they don’t try to
sell you. He is smart enough to know a sober man
would never buy one. Mind you, all this smelling
of breath is done, not on the Company’s time, but
on the time of the Workers. Some men have to get
up at 4 o’clock in the Morning to get their breath
examined so they can get to work at 8. Imagine a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</span>
line of 50 thousand all waiting to blow at a single
individual TESTER! Think what he must be with
all those Italian workmen passing by him. He is
just 180 pounds of Garlic by night.</p>

<p>The University of Michigan is putting in a Chair
in their Faculty devoted to the Art of Breath Detecting.
But there is always a way to defeat any reform.
Drinkers will learn to hold their breath like
a Diver.</p>

<p>I tell you Folks, all Politics is Apple Sauce.</p>

<p>The President gave a Luncheon for the visiting
Governors, where they discussed but didn’t TRY
Prohibition.</p>

<p>It was the consensus of opinion of all their
speeches that there was a lot of drinking going on
and that if it wasn’t stopped by January that they
would hold another meeting and try and get rid of
some of the stuff.</p>

<p>Senator Curtis proposed a bill this week to stop
Bootlegging in the Senate, making it unlawful for
any member to be caught selling to another member
while on Government property. While the bill was
being read a Government employe fell just outside
the Senate door and broke a Bottle of Pre-War Stuff
(made just before last week’s Turkish War). Now<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</span>
they are carpeting all the halls with a heavy material
so in case of a fall there will be no serious loss.</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowp60" id="i031" style="max-width: 44.75em;">

  <figcaption class="caption">THEY ARE CARPETING ALL THE HALLS OF THE SENATE SO IN CASE OF A FALL

</figure>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</span></p>
<p>Well, New Years is coming and I suppose we will
have to hear and read all those big men’s New
Year greetings, such men as Schwab and Gary and
Rockefeller and all of them. Saying the same old
Apple Sauce. That they are Optimistic of the coming
year and everybody must put their shoulder to
the wheel, and produce more and they predict a great
year. Say, if we had those Birds’ Dough we could
all be just as optimistic as they are. But it’s a good
Joke and it’s got in the papers every year and I
suppose always will.</p>

<p>Now the Ku Klux is coming into New York and
kinder got it in for the Jewish People. Now they
are wrong; I am against that. If the Jewish People
here in New York City hadn’t jumped in and made
themselves good fellows and helped us celebrate our
Christmas, the thing would have fell flat. They sold
us every Present.</p>

<p>The Ku Klux couldn’t get much of a footing here
in New York. If there was some man they wanted
to take out and Tar and Feather they wouldn’t know
where he lived. People move so often here their
own folks don’t know where they live.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</span></p>

<p>And even if they found out the Elevator man in
the Apartment wouldn’t let ’em up.</p>

<p>See where there is bills up in Congress now to
change the Constitution all around, elect the President
in a different way and have Congress meet at a
different time. It seems the men who drew up this
thing years ago didn’t know much and we are just
now getting a bunch of real fellows who can take
that old Parchment and fix it up like it should have
been all these years. It seems it’s just been luck
that’s got us by so far. Now when they get the
Constitution all fixed up they are going to start in
on the 10 Commandments, just as soon as they
find somebody in Washington who has read them.</p>

<p>See where they are talking about another Conference
over here. The Social Season in Washington
must be lagging.</p>

<p>Well, I think they ought to have it. These Conferences
don’t really do any harm and they give certain
Delegates pleasure. Of course nothing they
ever pass on is ever carried out. (Except in Greece,
where they are all carried out.) But each Nation
gets a certain amount of Publicity out of it, and us
masses that read of it get a certain amount of amusement
out of it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</span></p>

<p>Borah himself admits he don’t know what it’s for
or what they should do. But it looks like a good
Conference season and there is no reason why we
shouldn’t get in on one.</p>

<p>BESIDES, DID YOU EVER REALIZE THIS COUNTRY IS
4 CONFERENCES BEHIND NOW?</p>

<p>I want to apologize and set my many readers
straight as to why I am blossoming out as an infliction
on you all.</p>

<p>It seems a prominent newspaper syndicate had
Lloyd George signed up for a pack of his Memoirs.
Well, after the late election Lloyd couldn’t seem to
remember anything, so they sent for me to fill in
the space where he would have had his junk.</p>

<p>You see, they wanted me in the first place, but
George came along and offered to work cheaper, and
also to give his to charity. That benevolence on his
part was of course before England gave him his two
weeks’ notice.</p>

<p>Now I am also not to be outdone by an ex-Prime
Minister donating my receipts from my Prolific
Tongue to a needy charity. The total share of this
goes to the civilization of three young heathens,
Rogers by name, and part Cherokee Indians by
breeding.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</span></p>

<p>Now, by wasting seven minutes, if you are a good
reader—and ten to twelve if you read slow—on me,
you are really doing a charitable act yourself by preventing
these three miniature bandits from growing
up in ignorance. So please help a man with not
only one little Megan, but three little Megans.</p>

<p>A great many people may think that this is the
first venture of such a conservative paper as the
<i>Illiterate Digest</i> in using something of a semi-humorous
nature, but that is by no means the case. I
am following the Kaiser, who rewrote his life after
it was too late. I realize what a tough job I have,
succeeding a man who to be funny only had to relate
the facts.</p>

<p>Please don’t consider these as my memoirs. I am
not passing out of the picture, as men generally are
who write those things.</p>

<p>Since I last wrote you all there has been an
awful lot of fashion Shows and all their By
Products held here in New York. All the out
of Town buyers from all over have been here. So,
on behalf of New York City, I had to help welcome
them at their various Banquets. There was the retail
Milliners’ big fashion show at the Astor Ball
Room where they showed 500 Hats and me. Some
of the hats were just as funny looking as I was.</p>

<p>Well, I settled the Hat and Dress business to the
satisfaction of everybody but the Milliners. So the
next night at the Commodore Hotel I mingled with
those Princes of Brigands, the Leather and Shoe
men, and later I want to tell all you people just how
they operate. For we never paid more for our Shoes
and were nearer barefooted than we are today, so
don’t think that I am bought off this week by those
Pasteboard Highbinders: it’s only that I want to talk
to the Ladies today.</p>

<p>During this reign of Indigestion I was called on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</span>
to speak at a big Banquet at the Waldorf to the
Corset Manufacturers. Now that only shows you
what a degrading thing this after Dinner speaking
is. I want to get out of it in a few weeks and back
to the Movies.</p>

<p>This speaking calls on a fellow to learn something
about articles that a self-respecting man has no business
knowing about. So that’s why I am going to
get away. If a Man is called on to tell in a Public
Banquet room what he knows about Corsets, there
is no telling what other Ladies’ wearing apparel he
might be called on to discuss. So me back to the
Morals of Hollywood before it’s too late.</p>

<p>I was, at that, mighty glad to appear at a dinner
given by an essential Industry. Just imagine, if you
can, if the flesh of this Country were allowed to
wander around promiscuously! Why, there ain’t no
telling where it would wind up. There has got to
be a gathering or a get-together place for everything
in this world, so, when our human Bodies get beyond
our control, why we have to call on some mechanical
force to help assemble them and bring back what
might be called the semblance of a human frame.</p>

<p>These Corset Builders, while they might not do a
whole lot to help civilization, are a tremendous aid<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</span>
to the Eyesight. They have got what you would
call a Herculean task as they really have to improve
on nature. The same problem confronts them that
does the people that run the Subways in New York
City. They both have to get so many pounds of
human flesh into a given radius. The subway does
it by having strong men to push and shove until they
can just close the door with only the last man’s foot
out. But the Corset Carpenters arrive at the same
thing by a series of strings.</p>

<p>They have what is known as the Back Lace. This
is known as a One Man Corset.</p>

<p>Now the Front Lace can be operated without a
confederate. By judiciously holding your breath and
with a conservative intake on the Diaphragm you
arrange yourself inside this. Then you tie the
strings to the door knob and slowly back away.
When your speedometer says you have arrived at
exactly 36, why, haul in your lines and tie off.</p>

<p>We have also the Side Lace that is made in case
you are very fleshy, and need two accomplices to
help you congregate yourself. You stand in the
middle and they pull from both sides. This acts
something in the nature of a vise. This style has<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</span>
been known to operate so successful that the victims’
buttons have popped off their shoes.</p>

<p>Of course, the fear of every fleshy Lady is the
broken Corset String. I sat next to a catastrophe of
this nature once. We didn’t know it at first, the
deluge seemed so gradual, till finally the Gentleman
on the opposite side of her and myself were gradually
pushed off our Chairs. To show you what a
wonderful thing this Corseting is, that Lady had
come to the Dinner before the broken string episode
in a small Roadster. She was delivered home in a
Bus.</p>

<p>They have also worked out a second line of control,
or a place to park an extra string on the back.
You can change a string now while you wait, and
they have demountable strings.</p>

<p>Now, of course, not as many women wear Corsets
as used to but what they have lost in women they
have made up with men. When corsets were a
dollar a pair they used to be as alike as two Fords.
A clerk just looked you over, decided on your circumference
and wheel base and handed you out one.
They come in long Boxes and you were in doubt at
first if it was a Corset or a Casket.</p>

<p>Nowadays with the Wraparound and the Diaphragm-Control,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</span>
and all those things a Corset Manufacturer
uses more rubber than a Tire Co.</p>

<p>Imagine me being asked to talk at a Corset
Dinner, anyway; Me, who has been six years with
Ziegfeld Follies and not a Corset in the Show.</p>

<p>Men have gone down in History for shaping the
destinies of Nations, but I tell you this set of Corset
Architects shape the Destinies of Women and that
is a lot more important than some of the shaping
that has been done on a lot of Nations that I can
name off hand. Another thing makes me so strong
for them, if it wasn’t for the Corset Ads in Magazines
men would never look at a Magazine.</p>

ETIQUETTE</h2>
</div>


<p>Somebody must have seen me out in Public;
I think it was Emily Post, for she sent me a
book on ETIQUETTE that she had written
herself.</p>

<p>It has 700 pages in it. You wouldn’t think there
was that much Etiquette, would you! Well, I hadn’t
read far when I found that I was wrong on most
every line of the whole Book.</p>

<p>Now, you wouldn’t think a Person could live
under fairly civilized conditions (as I imagined I
was doing) and be so dumb as to not have at
least one of these forms of Etiquette right. Well,
when I got through reading it, I felt like I had
been a heathen all my life. But after I got to
noticing other people I met I didn’t feel so bad.
Some of them didn’t know much more about it than
I did.</p>

<p>So I predict that her Book and all the other
things you read now on Etiquette are going to fall
on fertile soil. Now take, for instance, being introduced,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</span>
or introducing someone; that is the first
thing in the Book. I didn’t know up to then that
inflection of the voice was such a big factor in introductions.</p>

<p>She says that the prominence of the party being
introduced determines the sound of the voice, as
she says for instance, “Are you there?” and then
on finding out you are there she says, “Is it raining?”</p>

<p>Now the inflection that you use on asking any one
if they are there, is the same inflection that you
are to use on introducing Mr. Gothis, if he is the
more prominent of the two. Then for the other
person, who Mr. Gothis probably got his from, why,
you use the “Is it raining?” inflection.</p>

<p>You see, a fellow has to know a whole lot more
than you think he does before he can properly introduce
people to each other. First he has to be
up on his Dunn and Bradstreet to tell which of
the two is the more prominent. Second, he has to
be an Elocutionist so he will know just where to
bestow the inflection.</p>

<p>Well, I studied on that introduction Chapter till
I thought I had it down pat. So I finally got a
chance to try it out. My wife had invited a few<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</span>
friends for Dinner, and as she hadn’t finished cooking
it before they come, I had to meet them and
introduce them to each other.</p>

<p>Well, I studied for half an hour before they
come, trying to figure out which one was the most
prominent so I could give her the “Are you there?”
inflection. It was hard to figure out because any
one of them couldn’t be very prominent and be
coming to our House for Dinner. So I thought,
well, I will just give them both the “Is it raining?”
inflection.</p>

<p>Then I happened to remember that the Husband
of one of them had just bought a Drug Store, so
I figured that I better give her the benefit of the
“Are you there?” inflection, for if Prohibition stays
in effect it’s only a matter of days till her Husband
will be prominent.</p>

<p>So, when they arrived I was remembering my
opening Chapter of my Etiquette on Introductions.
When the first one come I was all right; I didn’t
have to introduce her to anyone. I just opened our
front door in answer to the Bell which didn’t work.
But I was peeping through the Curtains, and as
I opened the door to let her in 2 of our Dogs
and 4 Cats come in.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</span></p>

<p>Well, while I was shooing them out, apologizing,
and trying to make her believe it was unusual for
them to do such a thing, now there I was! This
Emily Post wrote 700 pages on Etiquette, but not
a line on what to do in an emergency to remove
Dogs and Cats and still be Nonchalant.</p>

<p>The second Lady arrived just as this Dog and
Cat Pound of ours was emptying. She was the new
Prescription Store Owner’s Wife and was to get
the “Are you there?” inflection. Her name was (I
will call her Smith, but that was not her name).
She don’t want it to get out that she knows us.</p>

<p>Well, I had studied that Book thoroughly but
those animals entering our Parlor had kinder upset
me. So I said, “Mrs. Smith, Are you there? I
want you to meet Mrs. Jones. Is it raining?”</p>

<p>Well, these Women looked at me like I was
crazy. It was a silly thing to say. Mrs. Smith
was there of course, or I couldn’t have introduced
her, and asking Mrs. Jones if it was raining was
most uncalled for, because I had just looked out
myself and, besides, any one that ever lived in
California knows it won’t rain again till next year.</p>

<p>But that didn’t discourage me. I kept right on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</span>
learning and from now on I am just mangy with
Etiquette.</p>

<p>Why, just the other day, I heard what I had
always considered up to then a well behaved Woman,
introduce one Gentleman friend to another and she
said, “Allow me to present.”</p>

<p>Now anybody that’s ever read the first 5 lines
in the book knows that the word Present is never
used only on formal occasions. You should always
say “May I introduce” on all informal occasions.
There was a Woman who, to look at her, you
would never have thought she could possibly be
so rude and uncultured as to have made a mistake
like that.</p>

<p>It just spoiled her for me. I don’t care how
many nice things she may do in the future, she
just don’t belong.</p>

<p>Rule 2, Chapter 5—: “No Gentleman under any
circumstances chews Gum in Public.” Now that
kinder knocked me for a Goal, for I had been Chewing
Gum before some of the best families in this
Country. But from now on it is out. I am going
to live according to the Book.</p>

<p>Chapter 6—: “Gentleman should not walk along
the Street with their Cane or Stick striking the picket<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</span>
fence. Such habits should be curbed in the nursery.”</p>

<p>Now that rule didn’t hit me so hard for I am
not lame and I don’t carry a Cane yet, and furthermore,
there is no Picket fences in California. If
they had enough pickets to make a fence they would
take them and build another Bungalow and rent it.</p>

<p>Outside of eating with a sharp knife, there is
no rule in the Book that lays you liable to as much
criticism as the following: “Whether in a private
Car, a Taxi, or a carriage, a lady must never sit
on a Gentleman’s left, because according to European
Etiquette a Lady ‘on the left’ is no lady.”</p>

<p>I thought at first when I read that it was a misprint,
and meant a Lady should never sit on a
Gentleman’s Lap, instead of Left. But now I find
that it really was Left. So I guess you can go
ahead and sit on the lap. It don’t say not to. But
don’t sit on his Left, or you can never hope to enter
smart society.</p>

<p>Then it says “the Owner of the car should always
occupy the right hand side of the rear seat.” No
matter how many payments he has to make on it,
that is considered his seat.</p>

<p>Chapter 7 is given over entirely to The Opera.
What to wear, when to applaud—it tells everything
but how to enjoy the thing. The fellow that figures
out how to enjoy the Opera in a foreign tongue,
without kidding himself or fourflushing, has a fortune
in store for him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</span></p>
<p>Chapter 12 tells how the Butler should dress.
You don’t know what a relief it was to me to find
that news. I never had one, but if I do I will
know what to costume him in.</p>

<p>The Book says: “At six o’clock the Butler puts
on his dress Suit. The Butler’s suit differs from
that of a Gentleman by having no braid on his
trousers.”</p>

<p>Now all you Birds that never could tell the Servants
from the Guests, except somebody called one
of them a Butler and the other a Gentleman, you
can’t tell them that way. More than likely the
Butler is the Gentleman of the two.</p>

<p>But I can tell the Butler. He has no braid on
his trousers.</p>

<p>Now, all I got to do is find out how to tell the
Gentleman.</p>

<p>If you see people walking around looking down
at your trousers, in the future, you will know they
are looking to see if the braid is left off.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="DEFENDING_MY_SOUP_PLATE_POSITION_2">DEFENDING MY SOUP PLATE POSITION</h2>
</div>


<p>A couple of weeks ago in my weekly Hamburger,
I had the following, “If Mrs. J. W.
Davis ever gets into the White House we will
have a mistress to preside whom no titled European
visitor can embarrass by doing the right thing first.
She will never tip her Soup plate even if she can’t
get it all.”</p>

<p>Now comes along an old friend of mine, Percy
Hammond, a Theatrical Critic on a New York
Paper (Pardon me, Percy, for having to tell them
whom you are, but my readers are mostly provincial).
He takes up a couple of columns, part of
which follows:</p>

<p>“For years I have been tipping my Soup plate,
but never until Mr. Rogers instructed me, did I
know that I was performing a Social error. Consultation
with the polished and urbane head waiters
of the Middle West, where I spent my boyhood,
taught me, I believed, to eat Soup. One wonders if
Mr. Rogers has given as much thought to soup as
he has to the Lariat. Perhaps he does not know,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</span>
being recently from Oklahoma, that in many prominent
eastern Dining rooms one may tip one’s Soup
plate, without losing his social standing. I regard
Mr. Rogers’ interference as prairie, impudent and
unofficial. The Stewards of the Dutch Treat Club
assure me that it is proper to tip one’s plate, provided
(and here is the subtlety that escapes Mr.
Rogers), provided that one tips one’s Soup plate
from and not toward.</p>

<p>“Mr. Rogers might well observe the modesty in
such matters that adorns Mr. Tom Mix his fellow
ex-cowman. Mr. Mix, telling of a dinner given in
his honor at the Hotel Astor, said, ‘I et for two hours
and didn’t recognize a thing I et except an olive.’”</p>

<p>Them are Percy’s very words. Now Percy (you
notice I call you Percy, because if I kept saying,
“Mr. Hammond, Mr. Hammond,” all through my
Article it might possibly appear too formal), Percy,
I thought you were a Theatrical Critic. Now I find
you are only a Soup Critic. Instead of going, as is
customary, from soup to nuts, you have gone from
Nuts to soup. Now, Percy, I have just read your
Article on “my ignorance of Etiquette” (I don’t
know if that Etiquette thing is spelled right, or not;
if it is not it will give you a chance for another<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</span>
Article on my bad spelling). Now you do not have
to write Articles on my lack of Etiquette, my ignorance,
my bad English, or a thousand and one
other defects. All the people that I ever met or any
one who ever read one of my articles know that.
That would be just like saying W. J. Bryan was in
Politics just for Chatauqua Purposes. It’s too well
known to even comment on. Besides, I admit it.</p>

<p>Percy, I am just an old country boy in a big town
trying to get along. I have been eating Pretty regular,
and the reason I have been is because I have
stayed an old country boy. Now I wrote that Article,
and technically I admit I may have been wrong,
but the Newspapers paid me a lot of money for it,
and I never had a complaint. And by the way, I
will get the same this week for writing about you
that I did about Soup. Now both Articles may be
wrong, But if you can show me how I can get any
more money by writing them right, why I will split
with you.</p>

<p>Now you took my soup article apart to see what
made it float. I will see if we can’t find some
SMALL technicalities in your Literary Masterpiece.
You say I came recently from Oklahoma,
while You come from the Middle West and “by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</span>
consultation with the Head Waiters have learned
the proper way to eat soup.” I thought Oklahoma
was in the Middle West. Your knowledge of
Geography is worse than my Etiquette. You say
you learned to eat Soup from a Head Waiter in
the Middle West. Well, I admit my ignorance
again; I never saw a head waiter eat Soup. Down
in Oklahoma (probably near Siberia) where I come
from, we wouldn’t let a head waiter eat at our Table,
even if we had a head waiter, which we haven’t. If
I remember right I think it was my Mother taught
me what little she knew of how I should eat, because
if we had had to wait until we sent and got a head
waiter to show us, we would have all starved to
death. If a head waiter taught you to eat soup,
Percy, I suppose you were sent to Bordens to learn
how to drink Milk.</p>

<p>Then you state, “The Stewards of the Dutch
Treat Club assure me that it is proper to tip one’s
plate.” Now if you had learned properly from the
great social Head Waiters of the urbane Middle
West, why did you have to consult the Stewards of
the Dutch Treat Club? Could it be that after arriving
in N. Y. you couldn’t rely on the information
of the polished Head waiters of your phantom<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</span>
Middle West? Now I was in the Dutch Treat Club
once, but just as a Guest of Honor at a Luncheon,
and of course had no chance to get into any intimate
conversations with the Stewards. At that time, the
place did not impress me as being where one might
learn the last word in Etiquette.</p>

<p>And as for your saying that “anything of subtlety
would escape me,” that I also admit. I attribute it
to my Dumbness. But as for me being too Dumb to
get the idea of “the Soup plate being tipped away
and not toward one,” that’s not Etiquette; that’s just
Self Protection. As bad as you plate tippers want
all you can get, you don’t want it in your lap. Custom
makes manners, and while I know that it is permissible
to tip plates, I still say that it is not a
universal custom. Manners are nothing more than
common sense, and a person has no more right to try
and get every drop of soup out of his plate than he
has to take a piece of bread and try and harvest all
the Gravy in his plate. If you are that hungry, they
ought to feed you out of a Nose Bag. So, “prairie
impudence” or no “prairie impudence,” I claim there
are lots of them that don’t do it, even if it is permissible
(Head Waiters and Dutch Stewards to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</span>
contrary). It’s permissible to get drunk but we still
have a few that don’t.</p>

<p>Now, Percy, suppose they all did as is permitted.
Picture a big dinner with everybody with their soup
plates all balanced up on edge, with one hand holding
them up and the other hand with the spoon
rounding up what little soup was left. They would
resemble a lot of plate jugglers instead of Dinner
Guests. Why if that was the universal custom, I
would invent a triangle shape slide that could be
pushed under the plate, so it would permit you to
have one hand free, in case you were sitting next to
your own wife, or if by chance you might want to
use your napkin. According to your hungry plan,
every Guest practically handcuffs himself during the
latter end of the soup course. He is absolutely helpless.
So don’t ask head waiters and stewards what
to do, Percy, look around yourself. You will find
hundreds of them that are satisfied with just what
Soup they can get on the level. Why I bet you are
a fellow Percy, if you took Castor Oil, you would
want to lick the spoon.</p>

<p>You know, Percy, I might know more about Etiquette
than you think I do. I wrote a review on
Emily Post’s Book on Etiquette, and it was recopied<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</span>
in the Literary Digest (and by the way it
did not mention the Digest’s name, and it is unusual
for them to re-copy anything unless they are mentioned
in the article). Now have you or any of your
Mid-Western head waiters, or retinue of Stewards,
ever been asked to write a criticism on such an authoritative
work as that? So you see I am somewhat
of a Critic myself. I am the Hammond of
the etiquette Book business.</p>

<p>Another thing, Percy, I spoke of a particular case;
I mentioned Mrs. Davis. Well, I happened to see
the Lady in question eat soup, and she did not try
and corral the whole output. She perhaps knew it
was permissible, still, she did not seem eager to take
advantage of it.</p>

<p>Now, you speak of my friend, Tom Mix, where
he says, “he et two hours and did not recognize anything
he et but an olive.” Now, that is bad Grammar,
even I will admit, but it’s mighty good eating.
Don’t you kinder envy him, that he has lived his life
physically so that now he can eat for two hours. I
bet you that you would trade your knowledge of the
English language now for his constitution. Tipping
that soup plate at all your meals for years is what<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</span>
put that front on you, Perc. Leave some, that’s
why I am trying to prove to you it’s permissible to
tip the plate, but it’s bad physically. The fact that
Tom has done something to be given a dinner for,
should make him immune from attacks from the
Press Table.</p>

<p>Vice Dawes, the profanity end of Coolidge’s
Campaign, just went through New York last week
cussing everything, and everybody, a Hell’n Maria’ing
all over the place. But he has other qualities
to offset his cussing, so personally I don’t think this
word, “et” on Mix’s part will seriously affect the
drawing power of his pictures. You see, Percy, Tom
said, “et,” but you know better than him what to say.
Still, if a Western Picture was to be made to amuse
the entire World, I would trust Tom’s judgment to
yours. You know, Percy, everybody is ignorant,
only on different subjects.</p>

<p>So, Perc, you string with the High Brows, but I
am going to stick to the Low Brows, because I know
I am at home with them. For remember, if it was
not for us Low Brows, you high brows would have
no one to discuss. But God love you, Percy, and if
you ever want to leave them and come back to us<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</span>
where you started, we will all be glad to welcome
you, even if you do feel like you are slumming. You
must remember, Perc, that the question of the World
today is, not how to <i>eat</i> soup, but how to <i>get</i> soup
to eat.</p>

INCOME TAXES</h2>
</div>


<p>Well, I haven’t had much time lately to
dope out many new jokes. I have been
helping the Girls in the Follies make out
their Income Tax. A vital question come up, do
Presents come under the heading of Salary? You
know that’s a mighty big item with us. When I say
Us, I don’t mean Me, as no one has given me anything
yet, but I stick around in case a few crumbs
drop.</p>

<p>I have been looking for a bribe from some of
our prominent men to keep their name out of my
act, but the only ones who even speak to me are the
ones I mention. So I guess about the only way
you can get a Man sore nowadays is to ignore him.</p>

<p>One Girl wanted to charge off Taxi Cab fares
to and from the Theatre. I told her she couldn’t
do that. She said, “Well, how am I to get there?”
I said, “Well, as far as the Government is concerned,
you can come on the Subway.” She said,
“Oh! What is the Subway?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</span></p>

<p>Another Girl who has been with the various
Follies for ten years wanted to know what She
could charge off for Depreciation. And she was
absolutely right because if, after being with them
for that long, and you haven’t married at least one
Millionaire, you certainly have a legitimate claim
for Depreciation.</p>

<p>I reminded one of the Girls that she had neglected
to include two of her Alimony allowances.
She said, “Do I have to put them all in?” I said,
“Why, certainly you do.” The Girl said, “Well,
how did the Government keep track of them? I
couldn’t.”</p>

<p>One Girl charged off a non-providing Husband
under the heading of Bad Debts. We charged off
all Cigarettes smoked in Public under the heading,
Advertising.</p>

<p>One Sweetheart who paid for a Girl’s Dinner
every night, went thoroughly broke in Wall Street
by trying to corner Canned Tomatoes in the late
Piggledy-Wiggledy uprising. We figured up what
the dinners would be for the rest of the year and
charged him off as a Total Loss.</p>

<p>And right here I want to say what an honest
bunch these Girls are. They don’t want to beat<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</span>
the Government out of a thing. One Girl who
had been away for a few weeks last winter to Palm
Beach left a Husband in the good hands of her
Girl Chum. When she returned the Girl Chum
gave her a Two Thousand Dollar Bracelet. Now
she wanted to include this Item in her Tax and we
couldn’t figure out where to put it. Finally we decided
it was Rents, so we put it in, “For Rent, of
One Husband, two Thousand Dollars.”</p>

<p>Of course while the girls had these tremendous
salaries I was able to help on account of my technical
knowledge of them (as I dress with their Chauffeurs),
and on account of my equal knowledge of
making out an Income Tax, with any man in the
World. As none of us know a thing about it.</p>

<p>Look what I saved them on Bathing Suits! I
had them all claim they bought various Suits. And
I defy even a Congressional Investigating Committee
(and you certainly can’t pick any more useless
Body of men than they are), I defy them to say
that a Bathing Suit on a Beautiful Girl don’t come
under the heading of Legitimate Advertising.</p>

<p>Now, as I say, these Girls all wanted to do what
was right as they could afford to but this Income
Tax has not acted that way with the Men. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</span>
Income Tax has made more Liars out of the American
people than Golf has.</p>

<p>Even when you make one out on the level, you
don’t know when it’s through if you are a Crook
or a Martyr.</p>

<p>Of course, people are getting smarter nowadays;
they are letting Lawyers, instead of their conscience,
be their Guide.</p>

<p>There is some talk of lowering it, and they will
have to. People are not making enough to pay it.</p>

<p>And, by the way, the only way they will ever stop
Bootlegging, too, is to make them pay an Income
Tax. (At present it is a Tax exempt Industry.)
Income Tax has stopped every other Industry, so
there is no reason why it won’t stop Bootlegging.</p>

<p>Of course, some of our more thrifty Girls have
followed the example of their Male Tax Dodging
friends and Incorporated (as the rate is lower on
Corporations). Wall Street attended to that little
matter when they were drawing the Tax Bill up
in Washington.</p>

<p>These Girls had to do that, the same as men, to
protect their Salaries. Of course, the big Gamble
in buying into these Individual Corporations is the
Lucky chance that she might make one or more<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</span>
wealthy marriages during the year. When of course,
her being Incorporated, all she gets comes under
the heading of Income, and you, as a Stockholder,
get your Pro Rata Share. If she lands a big one
you have struck Oil. Then, on the other hand, she
may marry for love. In that case you have brought
in a Duster.</p>

<p>For example, down on the Exchange you will
find the Anastasia Reed, incorporated, along with
General Motors and Blue Jay Corn Plasters. At
the end of the year, the Stockholders, after adding
up the Salary along with the accumulated Alimony,
can either declare a dividend, or vote a Dinner and
put the Undivided profits back into the growing
Concern.</p>

<p>Now, I can’t tell you the name but I was lucky
enough to land 5 shares just before a Blonde Corporation
married a Multi-Millionaire who was over
70 years of age. Us Stockholders have figured out
at our last meeting that if he dies when we think
he will (and we have no reason to believe otherwise,
unless the Poison acts as a Monkey Gland) why,
just those 5 shares will make me independent for
life.</p>

<p>I don’t want to use this space as an ad, but I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</span>
have been able for a small monetary fee to tip
off my friends just what stock to buy. You see
I am in a position to judge as I watch who is in
the front row every night and I can just tell when
Mendelssohn’s Spring Song will start percolating for
some particular Corporation. Now, at the present
time, there is every night in the front row a Millionaire
Oklahoma Oil Magnate and a Bootlegger,
both angling for the same Corporation. If this
Bootlegging person lands her, why her Stockholders
are made for life, but if the Oil Magnate comes
through (for sometimes these female Corporations
are swayed by sentiment), why the stock won’t be
worth within a thousand Percent of what it will be
if the Bootheel Party lands.</p>

<p>Now, take me personally; this Income Tax thing
don’t bother me at all. You are allowed 200 dollars
for each Child, and my Children and my Income are
just coming out even now.</p>

AMERICAN LITERATURE</h2>
</div>


<p>The subject for this brainy Editorial is resolved
that, “Is the Song Yes We Have
no Bananas the greatest or the worst Song
that America ever had?”</p>

<p>I have read quite a lot in the papers about the
degeneration of America by falling for a thing like
it. Some lay it to the effects of Prohibition, some
say it is the after-effects of War, that it is liable
to follow every big war. I see where some have
written editorials on the Song claiming that things
are always in an unsettled state the year before a
Presidential Election. I claim it’s due to none of
these causes at all; neither is it due to the French
occupation of the Ruhr. I claim that it is the greatest
document that has been penned in the entire
History of American Literature.</p>

<p>And there is only one way to account for its popularity,
and that is how you account for anything’s
popularity, and that is because it has Merit. Real
down to earth merit, more than anything written
in the last decade. The World was just hungry for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</span>
something good and when this Genius come along
and got right down and wrote on a subject that
every Human being is familiar with, and that was
Vegetables, Bologna, Eggs and Bananas, why he
simply hit us where we live. You know a War
Song will only appeal to people that are interested
in war, a Love Song to those who are in love, A
Mammy Song to nobody at all, but when you get
down and write of Cabbages, Potatoes, and Tomatoes,
you just about hit on a Universal subject.</p>

<p>You see, we had been eating these things all our
lives but no one had ever thought of paying homage
to them in Words and Harmony. It opens up a
new field for Song Writers. I look for an epidemic
of Corned Beef, Liver and Bacon, Soup and Hash
Songs to flood the Market. So more power to
an originator. Did you ever stop to realize that
that Song has attracted more attention than anything
that has taken place in this Country since
Valentino gave up the screen for a mud Face preparation?</p>

<p>Magnus Johnson of Wisconsin or Minnesota
(they ought to put those States together; nobody
can ever remember which one anything ever happens
in, generally the same thing happens in both<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</span>
of them); well as I say, Magnus was unfortunate
enough to be elected to the United States Senate
at a time when Bananas was at its height. Ten
thousand people can sing the song that dont know
that Magnus can milk a Cow with one hand and
broadcast a Political speech with the other. Millions
can hum the Song that cant tell you what
Lloyd George is sore at England about.</p>

<p>Hiram Johnson arrived from Europe a Presidential
possibility, and spoke to 2 thousand people.
The creator of Bananas to Music, penned one Gem
of constructive thought, and spoke not to two thousand
but to one hundred and ten million.</p>

<p>Then some Editorial Newspaper writer has the
nerve to sneer at this marvelous Song, when perhaps
his writings never cross the County line. Why,
Italy has already made arrangements on account
of his honoring their National Diet to place his
name alongside of Michael Angelo, Garibaldi, and
Louis Firpo. It is already bringing on International
complications. England is sore because he
didn’t say something about Tea and Cake.</p>

<p>If we had had a Man like that to write our
National Anthem somebody could learn it. It
wouldn’t take three wars to learn the words.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</span></p>

<p>Mother has been done to death in Songs and not
enough consideration shown her in real life. We
thought when we sang about her we had paid her
all the respect there was. I tell you, conditions
were Just Ripe for a good fruit Song.</p>

<p>Geo. M. Cohan wore out more Flags than a
war waving them to music. He transferred the
Flag from Cloth to Paper, he made it a two verse
and Chorus affair. Now George was original. He
saw an idea; he knew that a big percentage of the
American people had seen the flag, so that would
give him a subject to write on that people knew
about. But look what a Universal subject this
Bird hit on. There are thousands of Foreigners
landing here daily that know Spin-ISH and HON-ions,
that dont know an American Flag from a
Navajo Blanket.</p>

<p>Did you ever just dissect the Words to some of
our so-called Popular Songs? One has the words
“Its not raining Rain, its raining Violets.” Now
can you imagine any more of a Cuckoo idea than
that? You cant hardly raise the things, much less
Rain em. Now which do we owe the most to, the
Violet or the Banana? Even such a Genius as
Geo. M. Cohan himself has a Song, “You remind<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</span>
me of my Mother when Mother was A Girl like
you.” How can any man remember his Mother
when she was a girl? Its a Physical impossibility.
You would have had to be born almost simultaneously
with your Mother.</p>

<p>Now on the other hand take the Banana Classic.
“We just killed a Pony so try our Bologna, It’s
flavored with Oats and Hay.” Now that’s not
only good Poetry but his honesty should be rewarded.
He is on the level, he is telling you just
what you get. Then those History-making lines,
“Our Hen Fruit have you tried em, real live
Chickens inside em.” Now I think in the rhyming
line that is a positive Gem, and will live when
Gungha Din has lost his Hot Water Bottle. That
shows originality. He is not just simply going
along rhyming Girl and Pearl, Beauty and Cutey,
Bees and Knees.</p>

<p>This Boy has got the stuff. Get this one and
then read all through Shakespeare and see if he
ever scrambled up a mess of words like these, “Try
our Walnuts and Co- CO- Nuts, there aint many
nuts like They.” Now just off-hand you would
think that it is purely a commercial Song with no
tinge of Sentiment, but dont you believe it. Read<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</span>
this: “And you can take home for the WIM-mens,
nice juicy per-Sim-mons.” Now that shows thoughtfulness
for the fair sex and also excellent judgment
in the choice of a Delicacy. Then there is
rhythm and harmony that would do credit to a
Walt Whitman, so I defy you to show me a single
song with so much downright merit to it as this
has.</p>

<p>You know, it dont take much to rank a man
away up if he is just lucky in coining the right
words. Now take for instance Horace Greeley,
I think it was, or was it W. G. McAdoo, who said
“go West, young man.” Now that took no original
thought at the time it was uttered. There was no
other place for a man to go, still it has lived. Now
you mean to tell me that a commonplace remark
like that has the real backbone of this one: “Our
Grapefruit I’ll bet you, Is not going to wet you, we
drain them out every day.” Now which do you
think it would take you the longest to think of,
that or “Go West, Young Man.”</p>

<p>Some other fellow made himself by saying “War
is Hell.” Now what was original about that? Anyone
who had been in one could have told you that,
and today he has one of the biggest Statues in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</span>
New York. According to that, what should this
Banana man get? He should be voted the Poet
Lariet of America.</p>

<p>Now mind you, I am not upholding this man
because I hold any briefs for the Songwriters. I
think they are in a class with the After Dinner
speakers. They should be like Vice used to be in
some towns. <i>They should be segregated off to
themselves</i> and not allowed to associate with people
at all, <i>and should be made to sing these songs to
each other</i>. That is the only way you will ever do
away with the Song writing business.</p>

<p>Another thing that has made it bad is these People
that used to send Scenarios to Moving Picture
Studios, after getting them back have turned them
into Songs. Its been a Godsend to the Picture
business but a blow to the Music business. And
those Mammy Songs—those writers should have
all been banished to Siberia, and as they went
through on their way to Siberia dont let them stop
in Russia to see their Mammy. But when one does
come along and display real talent as this one has
proven, I think he should be encouraged. Some
man said years ago that he “cared not who fought
their Countries’ Wars as long as he could write<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</span>
their Songs.” But of the two our Songs have been
the most devastating.</p>

<p>I understand this Boy was a Drummer in a Jazz
Band before this World renown hit him. Now I
personally have always considered the Drummer the
best part of the Jazz Band. I think if all the
members of a Jazz band played the Drums it would
make better music. I would rather have been the
Author of that Banana Masterpiece than the Author
of the Constitution of the United States. No one
has offered any amendments to it. Its the only
thing ever written in America that we haven’t
changed, most of them for the worst.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="PROSPECTUS_FOR_THE_REMODELED_2">PROSPECTUS FOR “THE REMODELED
CHEWING GUM CORPORATION”</h2>
</div>


<p>Last week I made, on account of my Movie
work, a trip to Catalina Island and along
with the Glass bottom Boat I had pointed
out to me the home of Mr. William Wrigley on
the top of the highest mountain. He also owns
the Island. We were not allowed to go nearer
than the gate as the Guide said some other Tourist
had carried away a Grand Piano, and he had gotten
discouraged at having them around. Another
tourist was caught right on the Lawn Chewing an
opposition Brand of Gum. That is really the thing
that gummed up the Tourist Parade.</p>

<p>Then I remembered having seen his wonderful
building in Chicago, all, mind you, accumulated on
Chewing Gum at a Cent a Chew. Now I felt
rather hurt at not being allowed to at least walk
through maybe the Kitchen, or the Cellar, because
I know that I have contributed more to the Building
of that Home than any one living. I have
not only made Chewing Gum a pastime but I have
made it an Art. I have brought it right out in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</span>
Public and Chewed before some of the oldest Political
Families of Massachusetts.</p>

<p>I have had Senator Lodge (who can take the
poorest arguments in the World and dress them
up in perfect English and sell them) after hearing
my Act on the Stage, say: “William” (that’s English
for Will), “William, I could not comprehend a
Word of the Language you speak, but you do Masticate
uncompromisingly excellent.”</p>

<p>This reception which I received at the Wrigley
Home was so in contrast to the one which I received
at Mr. Adolphus Busch’s in St. Louis. When
he heard that one of his best Customers was at
the outer Gate, Mr. Busch not only welcomed me,
but sent me a fine German Police Dog to California,
the stock of which had come direct from the
Kaiser’s Kennels in Pottsdam. The Dog did wonderful
until some one here by mistake gave him a
drink of Half of One Percent Beer. He would
have been six years old next May.</p>

<p>After looking on Mr. Wrigley’s home with much
admiration and no little envy, the thought struck
me: A man to succeed nowadays must have an
Idea. Here I am, struggling along and wasting
my time on trying to find something nice to say<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</span>
of our Public Men, when I should be doing Something
with Dividends connected with it. So then
the thought struck me: WHAT BECOMES OF
ALL THE CHEWING GUM THAT IS USED
IN THIS COUNTRY?</p>

<p>I just thought to myself, if Bill Wrigley can
amass this colossal fortune, and pay the Manufacturing
charges, why can’t I do something with
Second-Hand Gum. I will have no expense, only
the accumulation of the Gum after it is thoroughly
masticated. Who would be the most beneficial to
mankind, the man who invented Chewing Gum, or
me who can find a use for it? Why, say, if I can
take a wad of old Gum and graft it onto some other
substance, I will be the modern Burbank. (With
the ideas I have got for used Gum I may be honored
by my Native State of Oklahoma by being
made Governor, with the impeachment clause
scratched out of the Contract.)</p>

<p>All Wrigley had was an Idea. He was the first
man to discover that the American Jaws must wag.
So why not give them something to wag against?
That is, put in a kind of Shock Absorber.</p>

<p>If it wasn’t for Chewing Gum, Americans would
wear their teeth off just hitting them against each<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</span>
other. Every Scientist has been figuring out who
the different races descend from. I don’t know
about the other Tribes, but I do know that the
American Race descended from the Cow. And
Wrigley was smart enough to furnish the Cud. He
has made the whole World chew for Democracy.</p>

<p>That’s why this subject touches me so deeply.
I have chewed more Gum than any living Man.
My Act on the Stage depended on the grade of
Gum I chewed. Lots of my readers have seen
me and perhaps noted the poor quality of my jokes
on that particular night. Now I was not personally
responsible for that. I just happened to hit on a
poor piece of Gum. One can’t always go by the
brand. There just may be a poor stick of Gum in
what otherwise may be a perfect package. It may
look like the others on the outside but after you get
warmed up on it, why, you will find that it has a
flaw in it. And hence my act would suffer. I
have always maintained that big Manufacturers of
America’s greatest necessity should have a Taster—a
man who personally tries every Piece of Gum
put out.</p>

<p>Now lots of People don’t figure the lasting quality
of Gum. Why, I have had Gum that wouldn’t last<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</span>
you over half a day, while there are others which
are like Wine—they improve with Age.</p>

<p>I hit on a certain piece of Gum once, which I used
to park on the Mirror of my dressing room after
each show. Why, you don’t know what a pleasure
it was to chew that Gum. It had a kick, or spring
to it, that you don’t find once in a thousand Packages.
I have always thought it must have been
made for Wrigley himself.</p>

<p>And say, what jokes I thought of while chewing
that Gum! Ziegfeld himself couldn’t understand
what had put such life and Humor into my Work.</p>

<p>Then one night it was stolen, and another piece
was substituted in its place, but the minute I started
in to work on this other Piece I knew that someone
had made a switch. I knew this was a Fake.
I hadn’t been out on the Stage 3 minutes until half
of the audience were asleep and the other half
were hissing me. So I just want to say you can’t
exercise too much care and judgment in the selection
of your Gum, because if it acts that way with
me in my work, it must do the same with others,
only they have not made the study of it that I
have.</p>

<p>Now you take Bryan. I lay his downfall to Gum.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</span>
You put that man on good Gum and he will be
parking it right under the White House Dinner
Table.</p>

<p>Now, some Gum won’t stick easy. It’s hard to
transfer from your hand to the Chair. Other kinds
are heavy and pull hard. It’s almost impossible
to remove them from Wood or Varnish without
losing a certain amount of the Body of the Gum.</p>

<p>There is lots to be said for Gum. This pet
Piece of mine I afterwards learned had been stolen
by a Follies Show Girl, who two weeks later married
an Oil Millionaire.</p>

<p>Gum is the only ingredient of our National Life
of which no one knows how or of what it is made.
We know that Sawdust makes our Breakfast food.
We know that Tomato Cans constitute Ford Bodies.
We know that old Second-hand Newspapers make
our 15 dollar Shoes. We know that Cotton makes
our All-Wool Suits. But no one knows yet what
constitutes a mouthful of Chewing Gum.</p>

<p>But I claim if you can make it out of old Rubber
Boots and Tires and every form of old junk, why
can’t I, after reassembling it, put it back into these
same Commodities? No one has found a substitute
for Concrete. Why not Gum? Harden the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</span>
surface so the Pedestrians would not vacate with
your street. What could be better for a Dam for
a River than old Chewing Gum? Put one Female
College on the banks of the Grand Canyon, and
they will Dam it up in 2 years, provided they use
discretion in their parking.</p>

<p>Now, as for my plans of accumulation, put a
Man at every Gum selling place. The minute a
Customer buys, he follows him. He don’t have to
watch where he throws it when through; all he
has to do is to follow. He will step on it sooner or
later no matter where they throw it.</p>

<p>When he feels it, he immediately cuts off the
part of the shoe where it is stuck on, so he can
save the entire piece. Then he goes back and awaits
another buyer.</p>

<p>I have gone into the matter so thoroughly that
I made a week’s test at a friend of mine’s Theatre.
At one of Mr. Sid Grauman’s Movie Theatres here,
I gathered gum for one week and kept account of
the intake every day. My statistics have proven that
every Seat in every Movie Theatre will yield a half
Pint of Gum every 2 days, some only just slightly
used.</p>

<p>Now that gives us an average of a Pint and a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</span>
Half every six days, not counting Sunday where
the Pro Rata really increases. Now figure the seating
capacity of the Theatre and you arrive at just
what our Proposition will yield in a good solid
commodity.</p>

<p>Of course, this thing is too big for me to handle
personally. I can, myself, disrobe, after every
Show, one Theatre and perhaps a Church on Sunday.
But to make it National I have to form it
into a Trust. We will call it the “Remodeled
Chewing Gum Corporation.”</p>

<p>Don’t call it Second Hand; there is no Dignity
in that name. If we say “remodeled” why every
Bird in America falls for that.</p>

<p>Of course, it is my idea ultimately after we have
assembled more than we can use for Concrete and
Tires and Rubber Boots to get a Press of some
kind and mash it up in different and odd shapes.</p>

<p>(You know there is nothing that takes at a Dinner
like some Popular Juice Flavor to our Remodeled
and overhauled Product. I would suggest
Wood Alcohol. That would combine two Industries
into one.)</p>

<p>I want to put flavors in there where we can
take some of this colossal trade away from these<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</span>
Plutocratic Top Booted Gentlemen. If we can get
just enough of this Wood Alcohol into our reassembled
Gum to make them feel it and still not
totally destroy our Customer we will have improved
on the Modern Bootlegger as he can only sell to
the same man once.</p>

<p>Now, Gentlemen and Ladies, you have my proposition.
Get in early on, “Old Gum made as good
as New.” Think of the different brands that would
be popular, “Peruna Flavor Gum,” “Jamaica Ginger
Gum,” “Glover’s Mange Gum,” “Lysol Gum.”</p>

<p>It looks like a great proposition to me. It will
be the only Industry in the World where all we
have to do is to just pick it up, already made, and
flavor it.</p>

<p>I am going to put this thing up to my friend,
Henry Ford. Think, with no overhead, how he
could keep the Cost down. It’s a better proposition
than being President.</p>

</div>


<p>Well, I have just this minute returned
from Tia Juana, Mexico, where I along
with some thousands of other Scientists
went to observe the Total Eclipse. That is that
was their excuse for going. You know it don’t
take much excuse to get a man, or Woman either,
to go to Mexico nowadays. So when the Scientists
said that Los Angeles was only to get a 99 percent
Eclipse, (That is about the only thing I ever knew
Los Angeles to fall down on. They are generally
100 percent) it kinder hurt their pride. It was
the first time that Nature had ever handed them a
mere 99.</p>

<p>I don’t really think they would have ever gotten
over it but San Francisco only received some 85 or
90 percent so that kinder salved things over.</p>

<p>But the Chamber of Commerce has held a meeting
and voted Resolutions to apply for the next
Eclipse in its entirety. They claim that it was due
to the Club not giving the matter more thought that
they lost the One Percent on this one.</p>

<p>Well, the Scientist Road Map showed that Catilina<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</span>
Island and San Diego and Tia Juana, were
right in the path of total blackness. Everybody
that could get out of a Cafeteria line in time to
make the trip started for one of these places. Catilina
Island offered wonderful possibilities. You
could get two rounds of Seasickness, see the Eclipse
and get your Chewing Gum at cost—all in one day’s
pleasure.</p>

<p>San Diego is a Town built in the most South
Westerly part of the United States where Americans
who are coming out of Mexico sober up, before
being able to go to their various homes, and it is
really remarkable what a thriving Town it is. You
would be surprised at the business they do.</p>

<p>There are nice Hotels there with Ice Water in
every room, and even Banks where you can draw
Drafts on your Home Bank after a Day in Mexico
at the Tables (as they say in Monte Carlo books).
San Diego catches very few going down into Mexico,
(only the Punctures) as most People are in a great
hurry to get there, once you begin to reach this
Oasis.</p>

<p>So you see it didn’t take much decision on my
part to decide that if I, along with the other Scientists
who were to write on this Traffic accident<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</span>
in the Skies, wanted to pick out an observatory
there was no particular reason why we should select
a Dry one.</p>

<p>Well, my friend Mr. Henry Ford may or may not
ever be President, but I want to publicly say this
to him, that the people he sells his Cars to are of
a very high type of intelligence. I never saw so
many owners of one make of car so interested in
Astronomy in my life. There were not only Autos
of every make but people of every make, jammed
two rows deep for 150 miles struggling to reach
Tia Juana, Mexico FOR THE ECLIPSE.</p>

<p>You would see people going to Mexico to see
this eclipse, who, if you looked at them, you wouldn’t
think they knew when Sunday passed between Monday
and Saturday, much less when the Moon passed
between the Sun and Earth.</p>

<p>Now, as I say, we passed through some 70 miles
of United States Territory that was to be blotted
out totally, but there wasn’t an observatory in the
entire region. Being my first year as a Journalist
and this being my first assignment to cover a total
Eclipse for the various papers who crave my Scientific
knowledge, I am really ashamed to admit
it, but, outside of not even knowing what an Eclipse<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</span>
was or when one was to happen, I had never even
entered one of their Observatories where they watch
these Eclipses; so it was with the greatest anxiety
and enthusiasm that I dashed up to the Mexico
line.</p>

<p>The Country to the south of us we have lately
recognized. (The receipt for any other Nation that
wants us to recognize them, is to strike Oil, or
some other commodity that our Capitalists want.)
But this editorial is not on our Foreign Relations.
That I will take up in due time as we have some
Foreign Relations. This is to be on the Planets,
their various Routes, mode and speed of travel.</p>

<p>A great many Scientists, I had read in the papers,
were bringing Cameras to Photograph this remarkable
phenomenon. But most of the Scientists that
I saw had Jugs and Flasks. Well, not being up
on Science, I didn’t know what to bring. You know
these Scientists are such a queer lot I wouldn’t be
surprised at anything they do.</p>

<p>Well, I asked the Custom Inspector where the
Observatory was. He said, “Which one?” I said,
“Lick.” (That was the only one I had ever heard
of.) He said, “Right over there is one, if it ain’t
all Licked up.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</span></p>

<p>You never saw such an accommodating Country
in the World. Just think the preparations they
had gone through for the visiting Scientists’ Pleasure.
They had built these Observatories all over
the place right up to the line where you would lose
no time. You could start observing the minute you
got into the Country.</p>

<p>Now, there is apt to be among my readers some
who are as ignorant as I was about the inside of
an Observatory, so for their benefit I will explain
just what it is like. On the left, as you enter, is
a long Table affair, that runs the length of the
room. It’s really higher than a Table, and back
of it is a long Mirror where you get the reflections
of any local Eclipses that might happen. Then on
the bottom, outside this high counter, is a little low
railing that Singers’ Midgets could look over if they
wanted to see an Eclipse.</p>

<p>Now, up here in Los Angeles, they talked about
smoked Glasses, but down there they just filled them
and looked through them, and the more Glasses
you used, and the more different kinds of glasses,
why, the more Eclipse you could see. Some men
would have to get the man to let them try a dozen<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</span>
different Glasses before they could get the right
Focus.</p>

<p>Then, on the other side of the room, if you didn’t
want to look through glasses upside down, why
they had various other instruments of knowledge.
One was a Table with little Cubes cut square (or
apparently square) with Dots on them and the
Scientist would shake them in his hand and lay
down some Money, and then let them empty out
his hand. Then another Scientist, even more of a
Scientist, would pick up the money in one hand
and the little squares in the other and hand the
squares to another Scientist and put the money in
his Pocket. Then the same operation would be gone
through, till each Scientist, except the good one,
would be Gone Through.</p>

<p>I asked a visiting Astronomy Professor what the
idea was. He said, “You can see if you are right.”
I says, “What has that got to do with the eclipse?”
He says, “Why you bet on the passing.” So I bet
him I would pass but I didn’t, so now I want the
Scientist to figure out in what year I am going to
pass.</p>

<p>By that time it was 12.50 P. M. so I come out
of the Observatory as that was the time it was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</span>
supposed to be Total, but there wasn’t a Soul on
the Streets or outside any place. Everybody was
on the inside looking at the Eclipse. It was pretty
dark on the Street and a Mexican who lived in the
edge of the Town started milking his Cow, and
raising the mischief with his wife because she didn’t
have his supper ready.</p>

<p>One fellow staggered out of an Observatory and
I asked him if he had seen the Eclipse and he
said, “Which one?” But it certainly was a success
from a Scientific point of view, for away along
in the evening after it had gotten light, I saw
Astronomers piled up in every Observatory just
overcome by what the Scientists call the Corona,
or after effects of an Eclipse.</p>

<p>Oh yes, the Mexicans also put on for the visiting
Astrologers a Bull Fight. It was held at the lower
end of the Town. You had to pass every Observatory
in town before you reached the Bull Ring.</p>

<p>Well, I went down and there was lots of Natives
but very few Americans. As I say, it was held
at the wrong end of the Town for them to reach
it. I guess it was the only Fight ever held during
an Eclipse.</p>

<p>Can you imagine getting in a Pen with a Bull in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</span>
the dark. I wouldn’t even get in with one in the
light. Well, the Bulls turned out to be Steers. I
guess on account of the Eclipse and the Condition
the Americans would be in, the Mexicans figured
they wouldn’t know the difference. They didn’t kill
the Bulls, and the Bulls wasn’t lucky enough to do
any damage themselves. As a strict Humane man
I could see nothing to kick about, only from an audience’s
standpoint.</p>

<p>So I left Tia Juana and come back to this side
where everybody had looked at the Eclipse from
out of doors, and they all seemed to be kinder disappointed.
It didn’t do anything. You see from
the amount of Press stuff written about it most
people kinder thought it would do some tricks, maybe
juggle or shimmy or something like that. It just
passed—that’s all. I, personally, along with all
the others couldn’t see anything so wonderful about
it’s doing that. If the two planets hadn’t passed
but had hit, that would have been something to
see.</p>

<p>Of course, I will admit in this day of congested
Traffic, for any two given objects to meet and pass
without hitting is considered wonderful.</p>

<p>Everybody I talked with seemed to be unanimous<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</span>
that they would rather have seen the Dempsey and
Firpo fight. So I guess that is why they only have
Eclipses every 100 years so they won’t have to draw
from the same crowd twice.</p>

<p>But no one who saw it from Mexico had any
fault to find with it at all. If there is any great
thing happening and you are not right sure you
will enjoy it, why, go to Mexico and see it.</p>

<p>I tell you a thing looks different from a foreign
country. I wish I could have seen the Democratic
and Republican Conventions from Tia Juana.</p>

<p>The Eclipse was kinder overrated but I tell you
Mexico ain’t.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="ITS_TIME_SOMEBODY_SAID_A_WORD_FOR_2">IT’S TIME SOMEBODY SAID A WORD FOR
CALIFORNIA</h2>
</div>


<p>I attended a dinner the other morning
given for the Old Settlers of California. No
one was allowed to attend unless he had been
in the State 2 and one-half years.</p>

<p>I was the last speaker on the Menu. They put
me last, figuring everybody would either be asleep
or gone by the time I began.</p>

<p>Well sir, do you know, by the time it got to me
there was nothing left to talk on! But I just happened
to notice that in all the other speeches no
one had mentioned California, so as that was all
I had left I just had to go ahead and do the best
I could with California.</p>

<p>Now, it ain’t much of a speech but it is at least a
novelty, because in all my time out here I had never
heard the subject used before at any Dinners or
Luncheons.</p>

<p>Mr. Toastmaster, Ladies and Gentlemen, and
Members of the Old California Settlers Association:
Your previous speakers have taken up so
much time boosting and praising other States and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</span>
their People that it is now most daylight, and I
am at a loss to pick a subject, but at the last minute
I just happened to remember that no one had said
a word for California. So I will take up this very
remote subject and see if I can’t do something to
drag it out of the obscurity in which it has been
placed here tonight.</p>

<p>Being one of your old Timers (I have been a
resident of this State now for nearly 4 years; there
is only one other older member in the organization)
I want to say right here that you often hear it
said, “What is the matter with California?” Well,
I will tell you what is the matter—it’s MODESTY,
that’s what it is, too much MODESTY.</p>

<p>If we got out and blew our own Horns and
Advertised and boosted our State like Delaware,
and Rhode Island have, we wouldn’t be so little
heard of. So, whether you like it or not fellow
Statesmen, I for one am going to throw Modesty
to the winds and just tell the World off-hand a
few of the things that we have got out here.</p>

<p>Now, just picking subjects at random, what do
you suppose we could do if we wanted to say something
about CLIMATE? Why, that item alone
would draw people here. But what do we do?<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</span>
We just set here and say nothing. We go out of
the State and we are so darn generous that all
we do is brag on the place where we are. We never
think of handing our own State a little free advertising.</p>

<p>But you take, as I say, a fellow from Delaware,
and he is preaching Delaware and all its advantages
from the time you meet him till you leave him, and
by golly, it pays to do that. Look at Delaware
today! So never mind this old good fellow spirit
of giving the other fellow the best of it. I believe
in throwing in a little boost for the old Native
Heath.</p>

<p>Now I know you other members don’t agree
with me and think that we should think of our
proud traditions and not stoop so low as to have
to advertise but I tell you that this day and time
is a commercial Age, and we have got to throw
our Pride away and let the World know just what
we have here.</p>

<p>There is no reason why other People from neighboring
States shouldn’t know of our Climate. Why
keep it hid? It’s here. We got it. They can’t
take it away with them.</p>

<p>Of course, I will admit that we have done a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</span>
little good in a small way with Picture Post Cards.
Five years ago Iowa was a prosperous and satisfied
State. They had no idea of leaving. They had
shoveled snow for 5 months every year and figured
they would always shovel snow 5 months every
year. But finally one day a Twenty Dollar Bill
come into the State and a Farmer wanted to get
change for it, so he started out trying to get it
changed and wound up in Long Beach, California.</p>

<p>A fellow selling Roses in January changed it for
him, and when the Farmer pulled off his Mittens
to count the change he found that it was warm
and he didn’t have to put the mittens back on
again. That made quite a hit with him and he
decided to stay awhile. So he sent a Picture Post
Card back with the Picture of a Man Picking
Oranges off the trees in January, and told them
how fine it was and everybody that read the Post
Card, including the Postmaster come on out.</p>

<p>So when they came they sent back Picture Post
Cards to all their Friends who liked Oranges, and
in time they came too, and so on, each newcomer
bringing out just as many more as he could afford
Post Cards. Now in the short space of 5 years<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</span>
look what has happened. The whole of the State
of Iowa is here. The only ones left back there
are the ones who can’t read the Post Cards, or
People who don’t care for Oranges, and now I see
where they have put in Schools to teach those others
to read so that means we will eventually have them
all, with the exception of the ones who don’t like
Oranges.</p>

<p>Now, as I say, if all of that can be done with
just Picture Post Cards, what do you suppose could
have been done if the Newspapers of our State
had thought to have said something in praise of
our Climate? So, Fellow Old Timers, if we can
get the grand State of Iowa out here on a Picture
Post Card of an Orange Tree, what could we do
with some of these other States if we really devoted
a little of our time to it!</p>

<p>Why, Oranges are a small time commodity with
us. We raise more Beans on one farm here without
Irrigating than we do Oranges in the whole
State. If we had Picture Post Cards of Bean Fields
instead of Orange Fields we could get the whole
of Boston here the same as we did with Iowa.
You will do even better with Boston than you did
with Iowa because everybody there likes Beans.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</span>
So let’s get busy and let them know what we are
doing in the Bean line.</p>

<p>Take the case of Oil. You all know we struck
Oil here in Southern California. But did you let
anybody else know it? No, you didn’t say a word
about it, and as a consequence, a man can’t even
find a place to buy an Oil Stock. Now there are
lots of People would buy shares and Units, but
no, you are so darn MODEST you won’t let the
World know what we have.</p>

<p>I would like to have seen what Delaware would
have done if they had found this much Oil. They
would have sold so much Stock that if the Pacific
Ocean had been Oil it wouldn’t have paid back the
Buyers.</p>

<p>Look at Real Estate. Here we have the greatest
Land and Lots that ever laid out of doors, but
do we do anything with them? No! We just set
here. We never advertise them; we never boost
them. I wish you could see what the State of Delaware
would do if they had the same class of lots
that we have here. Why they would have Sub-Divisions
all over the place. They would have Barbecues,
and Drawings, and Scream Stars personally
appearing, and men under umbrellas selling each<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</span>
lot. But no, we are too conservative; we like to
sit here and let the stuff speak for itself. But I
tell you, Fellow Old Timers, you can’t do that nowadays.
It’s all right for a State to build up a
Reputation for Modesty and be known as always
having a good word to say for the other place, but
I tell you we have carried it too far for our own
good.</p>

<p>Of course I can appreciate you other old Timers’
feelings in the matter. You have been here and
helped build it to what it even is today, and you
resent these Johnny Newcomers coming in and
spoiling all of our old customs and Traditions. I
know it is hard to change with the Times. We
old Timers who have seen this place grow from
what it was 2 and a half years ago to what it is
today, must realize these stacks of young fellows
coming in here the last two weeks must have the
right idea, and we must begin to realize that after
all it is the general welfare of the entire community
we are after.</p>

<p>So, Fellow Members, if my little speech has been
the means of changing just one of you from your
Iron Clad rule of Modesty in regard to your Home<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</span>
state, why I will feel that my little efforts will not
have been in vain.</p>

<p>So from now on I am for letting the World know
of California, even if the rest of the State does
disapprove of it, and I sit down amid HISSES from
the MODEST Oldtimers.</p>

</div>


<p>Everybody at some time in life feels a call
within Him or Her, as the gender may be,
to try and Promote something or other, that
is to form a Company and sell Stock. We have all
bought so much and been stung so often that we
want to try the side where the Money comes in,
instead of going out.</p>

<p>One-third of the people in the United States
promote, while the other two-thirds Provide. There
are more commissions paid out to Stock Salesmen
than are ever collected by Stock Buyers. So, after
living honest for years, the thing naturally becomes
monotonous and we feel a hankering to Promote.</p>

<p>Now, I had reached that stage in life where I
had thought maybe I would get by clear to the end
without Promoting something and sticking my
Friends. But the old Bug has bit me; the old
Make-it-easy-without-working has got me. So I am
now branching out as a Promotor, Throwing the
Rope, Chewing Gum, Acting a Fool in the Movies,
Robbing Ziegfeld, and Writing for a Living. All<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</span>
these are side lines from now on. I am now a
Promotor. A Promotor is a man who would rather
stick a Friend than to sell Henry Ford a Synagogue.</p>

<p>Of course my proposition is different. (Did you
ever hear one of them pull that Gag before?)</p>

<p>My proposition is of Interest to every Town of
any size in America. I am forming Clubs, called
Swimming or Bathing Clubs, or any Aquatic name.
A great many Towns have been denied the privilege
of having these Clubs, heretofore, as they were not
situated near any Body of Water. Now I have
been to all the prominent Beaches in the East, and
this summer have had a chance to study the various
Water Resorts of California.</p>

<p>I have paid particular attention to the Habits
and procedure of Club Members and their Guests
and I think I can do the same for the Non-irrigated
Portion of this Country as is being enjoyed by the
Tidal Wave region.</p>

<p>I come into your Town and start promoting (we
will call it a swimming or Beach Club). I sell memberships
for, we will say, the nominal sum of 500
dollars a piece. That makes it high enough to keep
out the substantial people who really after all are<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</span>
rather old-fashioned, and allows us to take into
our Club some of our most prominent Bootleggers,
Oil Magnates, who have worked their way up from
the bottom in the last year, and just the people of
the Town who do things—in other words, the ones
who belong.</p>

<p>We build the Club House (a rather long rambling
affair) on some ground which we can get at a nominal
figure (as I will explain the value of Citizens
like we will have being located in their midst, and
what our Club will do for the surrounding Land).
Now, the great advantage that my Clubs will have
over the present ones in our Beach Cities is that
we will build ours right in the heart of the Town,
so the Tired Business Man can reach it even for
Lunch, whereas in other places they have to go
miles to reach a Beach Club. We will have a Uniformed
man at the door to meet the Cars, as nothing
impresses the newly rich so much as Gold Braid.</p>

<p>Our Cafe prices will be high enough so that if
a Member takes a friend any other place he will
be considered rather a short Sport. Each member
will have his Private Locker (including a Corkscrew),
where he can change to his bathing Suit.
There will be a wide Veranda under awnings where<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</span>
Members may dine in their Suits, and other Tables
which are not protected from the Rays of the Sun,
where the more Hardy Members may sit and acquire
a Tan.</p>

<p>Of course one item of expense in connection with
these Clubs which will require me to expend quite
a tidy sum is having Ocean Sand transported to
these Towns and then by Truck to the center of
the City.</p>

<p>This sand must be spread very, very thick, as
the principal pastime of the Members and Guests
will be to lay right down in it and try and cover
each other entirely up. Oh, it’s a ripping experience
that you in the inland Cities have missed, if
you have never tried it.</p>

<p>Mind you, this 500 dollars which I receive per
each will not all be profit as I will be called upon
to purchase a Medicine Ball or so. That is a Beach
Sport that only the most Athletic and reckless of
our Membership would dare enter into—tossing
this ferocious Ball from one to the other. I have
seen a Game of it last, if there were Female Spectators,
as long as three or four minutes.</p>

<p>Then, for the more skilled, there is Baseball on
the Beach which is played with a Rubber Tennis<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</span>
Ball. I have seen men graduate from that right
into some of our best Tea and Cake Hounds.</p>

<p>We will have beautifully striped Umbrellas placed
at intervals over the Beach for those who become
fatigued in parading. When there is a big crowd
and you have to walk by everybody in your Bathing
Suit it tires one more than the uninitiated would
think. And we’ll have a Life Guard (perhaps a
Native of Honolulu if we can procure one). At
any rate, we will get the most sunburned one we
can, for the less fortunate ones to compare their
Tan with. He will be provided with Smelling Salts,
and other restoratives in case a Wife should unexpectedly
discover her own Husband with some
other One Piece Suit Female Companion.</p>

<p>There will be Life Lines across the sands, so the
more fore-sighted of the members can find their
way during the afternoon back and forth to their
Lockers.</p>

<p>Now, I think I have enumerated all that is required
to successfully operate one of these Beach
Clubs. Of course, most of them heretofore have
had Water but in all my experience (which runs
over a term of years) I have never seen a Member
willfully enter this Water. Years ago at one of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</span>
the Eastern Beaches they claim a man went into
the water, but this has never been verified, and so
far as the ladies go, there hasn’t been a swell Bathing
Suit wet since Kellermann retired.</p>

<p>Now you see my scheme. I have laid it before
you. Nobody ever thought of it because they were
not a close observer like I have been. They just
naturally thought Water was required, but it is
the most unnecessary thing connected with a Beach
Club. Of course, Showers are provided for those
who do not care to sleep with sand in their bed.</p>

<p>Just think of a Club right at your door where
you can run down and change Clothes and display
your figure without having to go to Palm Beach
or Del Monte! Besides, I am showing you how
you can display it to the People who you want to
see it—not to a lot of strangers. Show it right
where it will do you the most good.</p>

<p>If I had thought of this sooner and we had had
one in my home of Claremore, Oklahoma (home
of best Radium Water in the World) and I could
have paraded up and down with my shape, I would
have been able to settle down a lot earlier.</p>

<p>I tell you my scheme is a boost for home Talent.
Many a Girl, if she could have shown off properly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</span>
at home, would have never had to leave there.
Now, if you think my scheme is crazy, you go to
the Ocean where there is a Beach to parade on
and see how many ever go in swimming where
there is nothing but Swimming Water.</p>

<p>No sir, the Sand and the Clothes are the thing—not
the Water. So I will put my scheme over,
not only for the selfish motive of making money,
but because I want to do something for the home
Town Girl who hasn’t the money to go to Narragansett
Pier to be properly appreciated, but can stay
at home and show how and what she is made of.</p>

PRINCE</h2>
</div>


<p>I want hereby, and hereon, to publicly issue
a protest to my fellow Writers, and Comedians,
against the use of Cartoons, Editorials,
Paragraphs, Free Verse, or any form of Public
Notice, Jibing, or Poking Fun or attempting to be
Funny, at the Expense of the Prince of Wales, falling
off his Horse.</p>

<p>My reasons are two fold, first on account of it
being passé, and secondly on account of the happenings
of the past week to my own Immediate
Person. Now everything is funny as long as it is
happening to somebody Else, but when it happens
to you, why it seems to lose some of its Humor, and
if it keeps on happening, why the entire laughter
kinder Fades out of it.</p>

<p>Last year in New York it was one of my sure
fire subjects to remark about the Prince of Wales
staking himself out a six foot Claim in some part
of England. And I remember one choice morsel of
Gossip I had was that I was going to get appointed
as Ambassador to England so I could go riding with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</span>
the Prince and be able to rope his Horse and bring
him Back to him. And another was, “I see where
the Prince of Wales fell off his Horse again today.
But that ain’t News any more. If he stayed on
That Would Be News.” Well that always knocked
the audience right back on their Flasks.</p>

<p>Now in those days, which was a Year ago, that
was very Komical both to me and the audience.
But of course now it has finally reached the Comic
Strip Cartoons, really earlier than a joke generally
does, and even the Editorial Writers are commenting
on it, in what they term a lighter vein. Now
an Editorial Writer is the last man in the World
to find anything out, so you will see how old and
out of date it must be to refer to now.</p>

<p>But all this has nothing to do with my real
Reason. I always have a few old Ponies for me
and the Children to play around with, so somebody
said, “Will, why don’t you play Polo? Anybody
that can ride can play Polo.” And me, like
a Fool, believed him. Why that is as absurd as
saying anybody that can walk would make a good
Golf Player, or anybody that looks good in a Bathing
Suit will make a good swimmer.</p>

<p>Now I want it distinctly understood that I did<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</span>
not take up Polo for any Social Prestige, or to
make myself pointed out as a Man about Town.
If I was the Champion Polo Player of the World,
I still couldn’t drink a Cup of Tea without using
the saucer. And another reason I always hesitated
on taking up the Game was account of the White
Breeches. I had always been reared to believe that
White Breeches should be concealed beneath Black
or Gray ones—at least in Public.</p>

<p>The people that think riding a Horse is all there
is to Polo, are the same people that think Curls
are all there is to Mary Pickford. I can also walk,
but I can’t sweep a Golf Ball into one of those
Holes with a Broom.</p>

<p>So I got me some of those long handled wooden
Hammers and started in at Polo. You know some
men like to have their Fields harrowed and plowed,
and I had not played Polo two days until I was
offered a job to come over and Play on their
Ground as they wanted it dug up. Finally I got
so every once in a while I would hit the Ball. But
it seemed like every time I hit the Ball it would
get mad and go off in an opposite direction.</p>

<p>Well, finally I got to playing in Practice Games,
more for the Comedy I would cause than through<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</span>
any good I might do my side. If the Purple and
Whites had a Game I might wear a Purple Jersey,
but in reality I would be playing with the Whites.</p>

<p>Then come a Polo Tournament held at Coronado
Beach. So as I was scheduled to play in one of
the Minor League, or Small Time events, I go
down and one day we are having a Friendly practice
Game with a few looking on. Three of us
beginners all bump together, Mind you, we are
all three on the same side. We knock our Horses
down, I fall on my head and of course, am not
hurt.</p>

<p>The Referee called an Unusual Foul. He said
I had fouled by running over two of my own side.
Well, the next day was the Big game; we were
to play the 11th Cavalry from Monterey. They
sure were a fine bunch of Boys, and hard Riders.
Things were going along Pretty Good until along
about the 3rd Act, I was on a new Pony who suddenly
reared up and Fell Back on Me. There he
was, a laying right across my Intermission. My
Head was out on one side and my Feet on the
other; that was all you could see. When he got
up I knew for the first time how the Prince must
have felt.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</span></p>

<p>Well, everything goes K.O. for two more periods.
I am on a Friend’s Horse and coming lickerty split
down the field, when for no Reason at all the horse
crosses his front legs and starts turning Somersaults.
They picked me up just south of Santa
Barbara.</p>

<p>The crowd all said, “Oh that’s Will Rogers the
Comedian. He just does that for laughs.” The
Papers next day all said, “Comedian Spills off Horse
Twice at Polo Game.”</p>

<p>Now I will admit there was not quite the same
Publicity given to all my various Falls as to those
of the Prince. But the hurt was just as bad. Everybody
that reads about it had been kidding me about
being the Local Prince of Wales of America. But
what I want to know from some of these Newspaper
Riders is what I am supposed to do in case
the Horse falls.</p>

<p>Are the Prince and I supposed to fall With the
Horse, or are we supposed to stay up there in the
air until he gets Up, and comes back up under us?
Every fall that the Prince has had has been caused
by a falling Horse, not by being thrown From one.
In the future the Prince and I will personally pay
in the papers for the extra two lines that will announce<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</span>
that “the Horse going down had something
to do with our going off.”</p>

<p>England is all worked up over his numerous Falls,
but up to now no one has manifested much interest
in any of mine, only for laughing purposes. At
least none of the prominent Washington Politicians
have asked me to cease my Riding. I want some
concern paid to my welfare. In my falls I am not
fortunate enough to spill any Royal Blood, but it’s
my Blood, and it’s all I got. It’s kinder funny but
no matter how common our blood is, we hate to
Lose any of it.</p>

<p>I saw a Picture in the Paper last summer where
the Prince was on one of his Horses and its name
was Will Rogers. Now I got all swelled Up when
I saw he had a Horse named for me, but maybe
that was the one that has been doing all this high
and lofty Tumbling. As a suggestion, if our respective
Countries want to do something to protect
our Welfare, the best thing I can suggest would
be to get us some Horses that can stand up, for
the Prince and I both have to take every Precaution
to protect our Looks. It would be terrible if
his face was marred. And I certainly don’t want<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</span>
anything to happen to Mine to make it look Better.
My living depends on it, just as it Is.</p>

<p>The only thing that makes me sore is that I
haven’t got the nerve to do some of the riding stunts
that the Prince goes after. He goes over Jumps that
I wouldn’t have the nerve to climb over on foot.
Then if he gets a fall a lot of us alleged Humorists
(who would be afraid to lead one of his horses
to water with a 20 foot Halter rope) start in rewriting
original Jokes about the Prince’s Horsemanship.</p>

<p>I saw a Picture of one of his Falls, where the
Horse had fallen trying for a Water Jump. Why
that Jump was so wide, that I bet we haven’t got
a Joke Writer in this country could swim across
it, and not over two could row over it.</p>

<p>I am not overly strong for Royalty, but if I
had to have one of Them over me I don’t know
of one that I would rather have than this same
Bird, and most of this Admiration has been won
by his Horsemanship, not by the Lack of it.</p>

<p>Lots of women have it in for him because he
has not married, But with all of them making a
silly play for him, I admire his Judgment as much
as his Horsemanship. So here is an appeal to my<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</span>
fellow Jokesters: If you want to kid somebody on
their Riding go to Central Park, don’t go to England
unless, as I say, you have some Solution for
a man staying up while the Horse is going Down.</p>

<p>P. S. I only had one thing to be thankful for
in my falls. I practically Ruined the only Pair of
White Breeches I had, of course, it’s all right with
the Prince—he can wear his Daddy’s. But from
now on I will get to play in Chaps.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="SPRING_IS_HERE_WITH_POEMS_AND_2">SPRING IS HERE, WITH POEMS AND
BATH TUBS</h2>
</div>


<p>Well, there has been quite a bit happened
since I last communed with you. Spring
is coming; I can tell by the Poetry and
the Real Estate ads. A Poet exists all year just to
get his Poem published in the Spring. Then when
he sees it in print he starts getting next Spring’s
verse all ready. These early Spring Real Estate
ads read, “This House is located on the shady
banks of a Beautiful stream.” Say, if there is a
beautiful stream anywhere now the Rail Road runs
along it and all you have to do is to get run over
by a freight train to reach this beautiful stream.</p>

<p>A favorite ad is, “Beautiful Home in heart of
the most exclusive Residential District, 5 Master
Bedrooms and 9 baths; Owner going to Europe.”
Now let’s just take that ad out and dissect it and
see what it is.</p>

<p>In a Real Estate man’s eye, the most exclusive
part of the City is wherever he has a House
to sell. The Dog Pound may be on one side and
the City Incinerator on the other but it’s still exclusive.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</span>
And it is, too, for it will be the only
house in the world so situated.</p>

<p>Five Master Bedrooms! Now, they get that
Master junk from English ads where the man may
be the master. Still, I don’t know why they call
all the rooms his. Over here they call them Master
Bedrooms but the Wife will pick out the Poorest
one for him, and keep the other 4 Good ones for
Company.</p>

<p>Now, to the ordinary man on reading that Ad
of 9 Baths, that would be an insult to his cleanliness.
A Man would have to be awful Busy to
support that many Baths, unless, of course, he neglected
some of them. The ad might better have
read, “Buy our home and live in a Bath Tub.” The
biggest part of City homes nowadays have more
Baths than Beds. So, while they can’t always ask
their Company to stay all night as they have no
place to put them, they can at least ask them to
Bathe. So, when you are invited out now, you
can always be assured of your private Bath, but
you must leave before Bedtime.</p>

<p>When you visit a friend’s newly finished Home
you will be shown through all the Bath rooms, but
when you leave you couldn’t, to save your soul, tell<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</span>
where the dining room was. They seem to kinder
want to camouflage or hide that nowadays. There
is such little eating being done in the Homes now
that a dining room is almost a lost art. Breakfast
is being served in bed, Dinner at the Cabaret with
dancing attached, and Lunch—no up-to-date Man
would think of going anywhere but to his Clubs for
lunch. Besides, didn’t he hear a funny one and
must get to the Club to bore his alleged friends
with it? He will talk everybody’s left ear off all
day and come home and bite his Wife’s off if she
asks him to tell her the news.</p>

<p>And then they have such an enlightening custom
nowadays. Every body of men who can think of a
name have a Club. And is not Congressman Blindbridle,
who has just returned from a free Government
trip to Bermuda, going to deliver a Message
at today’s Luncheon on “Americanism, Or what we
owe to the Flag?”</p>

<p>Now, as the dining room space has been eliminated
to make room for an additional Bath, most
of the eating, if one happens to be entertaining at
home, is done Off The Lap. This custom of slow
starvation has shown vast improvement of late. Instead
of the Napkins being of Paper, why, they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</span>
have been supplanted by almost-linen ones with beautiful
hemstitching. That’s to try and get your mind
off the lack of nourishment. As I say, the Napkin is
hand sewn but the Lettuce Sandwiches still come
from the Delicatessen.</p>

<p>Why, in the good old days, they couldn’t have fed
you on your lap ’cause you couldn’t have held all
they would give you. Now you have to feel for it
to find it.</p>

<p>But the Husband does come home some time
during the Day or Night, for is not the overhead
on his outlay of Baths going on all the time, and
shouldn’t he be getting home to get some good out
of some of them?</p>

<p>It’s not the high cost of Living that is driving
us to the Poor House,—It’s the high Cost of bathing.
The big question today is not what are you
going to pay for your plot of ground, but what
kind of fixtures are you going to put in your legion
of Bath Rooms. Manufacturers of Porcelain and
Tile have Supplanted the Pocket Flask as our principal
commodity.</p>

<p>The interest on unpaid-for Bath Rooms would
pay our National Debt.</p>

<p>Now, mind you, I am not against this modern<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</span>
accomplishment, or extravagance, of ours. I realize
that these Manufacturers of Fixtures have advanced
their Art to the point where they are practically
modern Michael Angelos. Where, in the
old days, an Elephant Hook was almost necessary
for a Wife to drag her Husband toward anything
that looked like Water, today those Interior Bath
Decorators can almost make one of those things
inviting enough to get in without flinching.</p>

<p>But, in doing so, they have destroyed an American
Institution, and ruined the only Calendar that
a Child ever had. That was the Saturday Night
Bath. Nowadays a Child just grows up in ignorance.
From the Cradle to the Altar he don’t know
what day of the week it is. In those good old
days he knew that the next morning after that
weekly Ear washing he was going to Sunday School.
Now he has not only eliminated the Bath on Saturday
but has practically eliminated the Sunday School,
for neither he nor his Parents know when Sunday
comes.</p>

<p>But, in those days, that old Kitchen Stove was
kept hot after supper. And not only the Tea Kettle
was filled but other Pots and Pans, and the Family
Wash Tub was dragged up by the Fire, and you<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</span>
went out to the Well and helped your Pa draw
some Water to mix with that hot. While you was
doing that, your Ma, if you stayed Lucky and had
a Ma up to then, was a getting out all the clean
Clothes and a fixing the Buttons, and a laying out
the schedule of who was to be first. And She was
the only one could tell just how much hot Water
to put in to make it right. And if anybody had
to feel of the hot water and get burned it was always
her, not you, and she found dirt behind, and in,
your Ears that all the highfaluting Fixtures in the
World can’t find today.</p>

<p>Now that was an event. It meant something.
It brought you closer together. But now bathing is
so common there’s No Kick To It. It’s just <i>Bla!!</i></p>

<p>The Romans started this Bath Gag; now look
what become of them. They used to have the most
beautiful Baths, kind of a Municipal Bath, where
they all met and strolled around and draped themselves
on Marble Slabs. It was a kinder Society
event. It compared to our modern Receptions.
I have seen some beautiful Paintings of them, but
I have yet to see a Scene where a Roman was in
the Water. But they did look, oh, just too cunning,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</span>
sunning themselves out on the Concrete Banks
of those Pools. It must have been like visiting our
modern Beaches, where no one can swim but the
Life Guard, and they don’t know that he can as
he has never been called on to go in. But, like the
Romans, our Girls can arrange themselves in the
most bewitching shapes out on the sand, which,
after all, must be much more comfortable than the
Asphalt that those little Cæsars had to spread
themselves over.</p>

<p>I tell you if Baths keep on multiplying in the
modern Home as they have lately it won’t be 5
Years till a Bath Tub will be as necessary in a
home as a Cocktail Shaker.</p>

<p>If two members of the same household have to
use the same Bath, it is referred to now as a Community
Tub.</p>

<p>Statistics have proven that there are 25 Bath
Tubs sold to every Bible.</p>

<p>And fifty to every Dictionary, and 389 to every
Encyclopedia.</p>

<p>Proving that, while we may be neglecting the Interior,
we are looking after the exterior.</p>

<p>If the Father of our Country, George Washington,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</span>
was Tutankhamened tomorrow, and, after being
aroused from his Tomb, was told that the American
People today spend two Billion Dollars yearly
on Bathing Material, he would say, “WHAT GOT
’EM SO DIRTY?”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="MR_FORD_AND_OTHER_POLITICAL_SELF-STARTERS_2">MR. FORD AND OTHER POLITICAL SELF-STARTERS</h2>
</div>


<p>Well, there has been quite a stir in the
Political News. The big news was the
Ford for President talk, made more important
by Mr. Hearst announcing that he would
back him if he run on an independent Ticket. It
only shows you what both of the old line Parties are
degenerating into. Nobody wants to associate with
either one of them.</p>

<p>I think that it will be the biggest boost Mr. Ford
will have that he don’t belong to either Party. It’s
getting so if a man wants to stand well socially
he can’t afford to be seen with either the Democrats
or the Republicans.</p>

<p>I expect, if it was left to a vote right now by
all the people, Mr. Ford would be voted for by
more people than any other man. But, if it come
to a question of counting those votes, I doubt if he
even run third. For, with all the mechanical improvements
they have in the way of adding machines,
and counting machines, they can’t seem to invent<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</span>
anything to take the place of the old Political mode
of counting—two for me and one for you.</p>

<p>More men have been elected between Sundown
and Sunup, than ever were elected between Sunup
and Sundown.</p>

<p>Our public men are speaking every day on something,
but they ain’t saying anything. But when
Mr. Harding said that, in case of another war
that capital would be drafted the same as men, he
put over a thought that, if carried out, would do
more to stop Wars than all the International Courts
and Leagues of Nations in the World.</p>

<p>Of the three things to prevent wars, League of
Nations, International Court, and this Drafting of
Capital, this last one is so far ahead of the others
there is no comparison. When that Wall Street
Millionaire knows that you are not only going to
come into his office and take his Secretary and
Clerks but that you come in to get his Dough,
say Boy, there wouldn’t be any war. You will
hear the question: “Yes, but how could you do
it?”</p>

<p>Say, you take a Boy’s life, don’t you? When you
take Boys away you take everything they have in
the World, that is, their life. You send them to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</span>
war and part of that life you don’t use you let
him come back with it. Perhaps you may use all
of it. Well, that’s the way to do with wealth.
Take all he has, give him a bare living the same
as you do the Soldier. Give him the same allowance
as the Soldier—all of us that stay home.
The Government should own everything we have,
use what it needs to conduct the whole expenses
of the war and give back what is left, if there is
any, the same as you give back to the Boy what
he has left.</p>

<p>There can be no Profiteering. The Government
owns everything till the war is over. Every Man,
Woman and Child, from Henry Ford and John D.
down, get their Dollar and a Quarter a day the
same as the Soldier. The only way a man could
profiteer in war like that would be to raise more
Children.</p>

<p>If any man went before the People on a platform
of that kind and put it over, he could remain President
till his Whiskers got so long he could make a
fortune just picking the lost Golf Balls out of them.
But, no, it will never get anywhere. The rich will
say it ain’t practical, and the poor will never get a
chance to find out if it is or not.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</span></p>

<p>Lincoln made a wonderful speech under similar
conditions one time: “That this Nation under God,
shall have a new Birth of Freedom, and that Government
of the people, by the People, for the People,
shall not perish from this earth.”</p>

<p>Now, every time a Politician gets in a speech, he
digs up this Gettysburg quotation. He recites it
every Decoration day and practices the opposite the
other 364 days.</p>

<p>If our Government is by the people, how is it
the Candidate with the most votes by the people,
going into a Presidential Convention never got
nominated?</p>

<p>Now, Lincoln meant well, but he only succeeded
in supplying an applause line for every Political
Speaker who was stuck for a finish.</p>

<p>And that’s the way with Mr. Harding; he certainly
meant well, for I can imagine his feelings
after having to mingle for the last 2 years with
some of our War Millionaires who are hanging
around Washington, just laying off between Wars.</p>

<p>And, in after Years, so will this speech of Mr.
Harding’s be quoted, but the minute the fellow
gets through quoting it he will go sign a War
Contract for Cost Plus 10 percent.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</span></p>

<p>In our Decoration day speechmaking Mr. Taft
spoke at some unveiling of a Monument in Cincinnati.
He made an Alibi for the Supreme Court.
I don’t know what prompted him to tell the dead
what the Court was doing, unless it was some man
who had died of old age waiting for a decision
from that August Body.</p>

<p>We can always depend on Judge Gary for a
weekly laugh in his speeches. But lately he had
the prize wheeze of his career. He had his accomplices
make an investigation of the Steel Industry,
and they turned in a report that it was
much more beneficial to man to work 12 hours a
day than 8. They made this report so alluring that
it is apt to make people who read it decide to stay
the extra 4 hours on their jobs, just through the
Health and enjoyment they get out of it. I never
knew Steel work was so easy till I read that report.
Why, the advantages they enumerated in this report
would almost make a Bootlegger trade jobs
with a Steel Worker. But here is the kick. Judge
Gary got up to read this report before the stock
holders who had made it out. He read for one
hour in favor of a 12 hour day. Then he was so<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</span>
exhausted they had to carry him out, and Charley
Schwab had to go on reading the sheet.</p>

<p>Now, if the Judge couldn’t work an hour, how
did he expect his workers to do 12 every day?</p>

<p>After Schwab read for 2 hours the audience was
carried out.</p>

<p>It was the greatest boost for the 12 hour day
I ever heard of. I am thinking of going out there
and working for them, but, if it is such a pleasure
to work 12 hours, I am going to try and get them
to let me work 18, at least, for I don’t believe
I would get enough pleasure out of just 12.</p>

<p>So if you don’t hear of me next week, you will
know I just enjoyed myself to death in Judge Gary’s
Steel Mills in Pittsburgh.</p>

</div>


<p>Some of the most glowing and deserved tributes
ever paid to the memory of an American
have been paid to our past President Woodrow
Wilson. They have been paid by learned men of
this and all Nations, who knew what to say and how
to express their feelings. They spoke of their close
association and personal contact with him. Now
I want to add my little mite even though it be of
no importance.</p>

<p>I want to speak and tell of him as I knew him
for he was my friend. We of the stage know that
our audiences are our best friends, and he was
the greatest Audience of any Public Man we ever
had. I want to tell of him as I knew him across
the footlights. A great many Actors and Professional
people have appeared before him, on various
occasions in wonderful high class endeavors. But
I don’t think that any person met him across the
footlights in exactly the personal way that I did on
five different occasions.</p>

<p>Every other Performer or Actor did before him<span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</span>
exactly what they had done before other audiences
on the night previous, but I gave a great deal of
time and thought to an Act for him, most of which
would never be used again and had never been
used before. Owing to the style of Act I used, my
stuff depended a great deal on what had happened
that particular day or week. It just seemed by
an odd chance for me every time I played before
President Wilson that on that particular day there
had been something of great importance that he
had just been dealing with. For you must remember
that each day was a day of great stress with
him. He had no easy days. So when I could
go into a Theatre and get laughs out of our President
by poking fun at some turn in our National
affairs, I don’t mind telling you it was the happiest
moments of my entire career on the stage.</p>

<p>The first time I shall never forget, for it was
the most impressive and for me the most nervous
one of them all. The Friars Club of New York
one of the biggest Theatrical Social Clubs in New
York had decided to make a whirlwind Tour of
the principal Cities of the East all in one week.
We played a different City every night. We made
a one night stand out of Chicago and New York.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</span>
We were billed for Baltimore but not for Washington.
President Wilson came over from Washington
to see the performance. It was the first
time in Theatrical History that the President of the
United States came over to Baltimore just to see
a Comedy.</p>

<p>It was just at the time we were having our little
Set Too, with Mexico, and when we were at the
height of our Note Exchanging career with Germany
and Austria. The house was packed with
the Elite of Baltimore.</p>

<p>The Show was going great. It was a collection
of clever Skits, written mostly by our stage’s greatest
Man, George M. Cohan, and even down to
the minor bits was played by Stars with big Reputations.
I was the least known member of the
entire Aggregation, doing my little specialty with
a Rope and telling Jokes on National affairs, just
a very ordinary little Vaudeville act by chance sandwiched
in among this great array.</p>

<p>I was on late, and as the show went along I
would walk out of the Stage door and out on the
Street and try to kill the time and nervousness until
it was time to dress and go on. I had never told
Jokes even to a President, much less about one,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</span>
especially to his face. Well, I am not kidding you
when I tell you that I was scared to death. I am
always nervous. I never saw an Audience that I
ever faced with any confidence. For no man can
ever tell how a given Audience will ever take anything.</p>

<p>But here I was, nothing but a very ordinary
Oklahoma Cowpuncher who had learned to spin
a Rope a little and who had learned to read the
Daily Papers a little, going out before the Aristocracy
of Baltimore, and the President of the
United States, and kid about some of the Policies
with which he was shaping the Destinies of Nations.</p>

<p>How was I to know but what the audience would
rise up in mass and resent it? I had never heard,
and I don’t think any one else had ever heard of
a President being joked personally in a Public Theatre
about the Policies of his administration.</p>

<p>The nearer the time come the worse scared I
got, George Cohan, and Willie Collier, and others,
knowing how I felt, would pat me on the back and
tell me, “Why he is just a Human Being; go on out
and do your stuff”. Well if somebody had come
through the dressing room and hollered “Train for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</span>
Claremore Oklahoma leaving at once”, I would have
been on it. This may sound strange but any who
have had the experience know, that a Presidential
appearance in a Theatre, especially outside Washington,
D. C. is a very Rare and unique feeling even
to the Audience. They are keyed up almost as much
as the Actors.</p>

<p>At the time of his entrance into the House, everybody
stood up, and there were Plain Clothes men
all over the place, back stage and behind his Box.
How was I to know but what one of them might
not take a shot at me if I said anything about him
personally?</p>

<p>Finally a Warden knocked at my dressing room
door and said, “You die in 5 more minutes for kidding
your Country”. They just literally shoved
me out on the Stage.</p>

<p>Now, by a stroke of what I call good fortune,
(for I will keep them always) I have a copy of
the entire Acts that I did for President Wilson
on the Five times I worked for him. My first
remark in Baltimore was, “I am kinder nervous
here tonight.” Now that is not an especially bright
remark, and I don’t hope to go down in History
on the strength of it, but it was so apparent to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</span>
the audience that I was speaking the truth that they
laughed heartily at it. After all, we all love honesty.</p>

<p>Then I said, “I shouldn’t be nervous, for this is
really my second Presidential appearance. The first
time was when Bryan spoke in our town once,
and I was to follow his speech and do my little
Roping Act.” Well, I heard them laughing, so I
took a sly glance at the President’s Box and sure
enough he was laughing just as big as any one.
So I went on, “As I say, I was to follow him, but
he spoke so long that it was so dark when he finished,
they couldn’t see my Roping.” That went
over great, so I said “I wonder what ever become
of him.” That was all right, it got over, but still
I had made no direct reference to the President.</p>

<p>Now Pershing was in Mexico at the time, and
there was a lot in the Papers for and against the
invasion. I said “I see where they have captured
Villa. Yes, they got him in the morning Editions
and the Afternoon ones let him get away.” Now
everybody in the house before they would laugh
looked at the President, to see how he was going
to take it. Well, he started laughing and they all
followed suit.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</span></p>

<p>“Villa raided Columbus New Mexico. We had
a man on guard that night at the Post. But to
show you how crooked this Villa is, he sneaked up
on the opposite side.” “We chased him over the
line 5 miles, but run into a lot of Government Red
Tape and had to come back.” “There is some talk
of getting a Machine Gun if we can borrow one.
The one we have now they are using to train
our Army with in Plattsburg. If we go to war
we will just about have to go to the trouble of
getting another Gun.”</p>

<p>Now, mind you, he was being criticized on all sides
for lack of preparedness, yet he sat there and led
that entire audience in laughing at the ones on
himself.</p>

<p>At that time there was talk of forming an Army
of 2 hundred thousand men, so I said, “we are
going to have an Army of 2 hundred thousand
men. Mr. Ford makes 3 hundred thousand Cars
every year. I think, Mr. President, we ought to
at least have a Man to every Car.” “See where
they got Villa hemmed in between the Atlantic and
Pacific. Now all we got to do is to stop up both
ends.” “Pershing located him at a Town called,
Los Quas Ka Jasbo. Now all we have to do is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</span>
to locate Los Quas Ka Jasbo.” “I see by a headline
that Villa escapes Net and Flees. We will
never catch him then. Any Mexican that can escape
Fleas is beyond catching.” “But we are doing better
toward preparedness now, as one of my Senators
from Oklahoma has sent home a double portion
of Garden Seed.”</p>

<p>After various other ones on Mexico I started
in on European affairs which at that time was long
before we entered the war. “We are facing another
Crisis tonight, but our President here has had so
many of them lately that he can just lay right
down and sleep beside one of those things.”</p>

<p>Then I first pulled the one which I am proud
to say he afterwards repeated to various friends
as the best one told on him during the War. I
said, “President Wilson is getting along fine now
to what he was a few months ago. Do you realize,
People, that at one time in our negotiations with
Germany that he was 5 Notes behind?”</p>

<p>How he did laugh at that! Well, due to him
being a good fellow and setting a real example, I
had the proudest and most successful night I ever
had on the stage. I had lots of Gags on other subjects
but the ones on him were the heartiest laughs<span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</span>
with him, and so it was on all the other occasions
I played for him. He come back Stage at intermission
and chatted and shook hands with all.</p>

<p>Some time I would like to tell of things he
laughed at during the most serious stages of the
Great War. Just think there were hundreds of
millions of Human Beings interested directly in
that terrible War, and yet out of all of them he
stands, 5 years after it’s over, as the greatest man
connected with it. What he stood for and died
for, will be strived after for years.</p>

<p>But it will take time for with all our advancement
and boasted Civilization, it’s hard to stamp
out selfishness and Greed. For after all, Nations
are nothing but Individuals, and you can’t stop even
Brothers from fighting sometimes. But he helped
it along a lot. And what a wonderful cause to
have laid down your life for! The World lost a
Friend. The Theatre lost its greatest supporter.
And I lost the most distinguished Person who ever
laughed at my little nonsensical jokes. I looked
forward to it every year. Now I have only to
look back on it as my greatest memory.</p>

<p>
Mr. Warren Gamaliel Harding.<br>
President of these United States and<br>
Viceroy of the District of Columbia.<br>
Chevy Chase Golf Club, Washington, D. C.<br>
<br>
My dear Mr. President,<br>
</p>

<p>I see where Mr. Harvey (I mean Col. or, rather,
Ambassador) Harvey is coming back here again.
Now I don’t know if it’s a slumming trip or just
what it is, as he was here a few days ago. Maybe
he forgot something in one of his Speeches and is
coming back for an Encore. But in a later Paper
I see where he is talking of resigning and not going
back. Now, if that is the case, I hereby make
this an open letter to you, Mr. President, as an
application to take said Mr. Harvey (I mean Editor)
Harvey’s place.</p>

<p>I can tell by observation that it does not come
under the Civil Service or competitive examination.
Neither, on the other hand, is it a purely Political
appointment, as Mr. Harvey adapted his Politics
to fit the occasion. Now that would not be even<span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</span>
necessary in my case as I have no Politics. I am
for the Party that is out of Power, no matter which
one it is. But I will give you my word that, in
case of my appointment, I will not be a Republican;
I will do my best to pull with you, and not embarrass
you. In fact, my views on European affairs are so
in accord with You, Mr. President, that I might almost
be suspected of being a Democrat.</p>

<p>Now I want to enumerate a few of my qualifications
for the position of Ambassador to the Court
of James (I don’t know whether it’s St. or Jesse).
But, anyway, it’s some of the James Family.</p>

<p>My principal qualification would be my experience
in Speechmaking. That, as statistics have
proven, is 90 percent of the duties of a Diplomat.
Now I can’t make as many speeches as my predecessor,
unless, of course, I trained for it. But I
would figure on making up in quality any shortcomings
I might have in endurance. For you know,
Mr. President, there is no Race or People in the
world who appreciate quality as the English do.</p>

<p>Now, the way I figure it out, what one has to do
is to make his speeches so that they will sound one
way to the English, and the direct opposite to the
Hearst readers back over here. Now George (I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</span>
don’t mean King; I mean Col.) was rather unfortunate
in that respect; he made them so they would
sound two ways, but both Nations took the wrong
way.</p>

<p>Now, for instance, if I wanted Mr. Balfour to
take something back, I would just kid him into it;
make him believe I didn’t care whether he took
it back or not. You know how it is, just like the
Democrat Senators do with Lodge.</p>

<p>Another qualification that must not by any means
be underestimated is my Moving Picture experience.
You see, for an official position nowadays,
we must pay more attention to how our public men
screen if we are to have to look at them every day
in the news films. We must not only get men with
screen personality, but we must get men who know
Camera angles and know when they are getting the
worst of it in a picture and not be caught in the
background during the taking of some big event.</p>

<p>Europeans are far ahead of us in this line of
Diplomacy, and, if you don’t watch them, you are
liable to be found photographed with the Mob instead
of the Principals. The thing is to do some
little thing during the taking of the picture that will
draw the audience’s attention to you. For instance,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</span>
during some Court ceremony, I could just playfully
kick the King. Now you don’t know how a little
thing like that would get over with the public. Or,
at one of the big weddings in the Abbey, I could
just sorter nonchalantly step on the bride’s train,
as they passed by, perhaps ripping it off, or any
little Diplomatic move like that. You don’t realize
how just little bits like that would make our Ambassador
stand out over all the other Countries.</p>

<p>We have had an example of screen training right
here at home. Take Josephus Daniels when he was
working. We spent 4 years sitting in Picture Houses
watching him launch Ships, and at every launching
he could place himself at such an angle that you
not only could not see the Democratic Governor’s
Daughter who was to break the Ginger Ale, but you
couldn’t even see the Ship. Now that was not accidental;
that was Art.</p>

<p>And did you ever notice in the weekly News
pictures how some Senators can take a chew of
Tobacco right in the scene and you catch yourself
watching them and no one else? Now those are
just a few of the little things that we have to look
after if we want to hold our own as the greatest
Credit Nation north of Mexico.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</span></p>

<p>Now, another thing, I ride horseback, so the
Prince of Wales and I could ride together and,
on account of my experience with the rope, I could
catch his horse for him.</p>

<p>Then I play a little Polo, just enough to get hit
in the mouth, but the English would enjoy that.
When they heard the American Ambassador had
got hit in the mouth and would have to cancel his
speech at the Pilgrims Club, why, that would of
course be good news to everybody. You see you
have to give as well as receive in the Diplomatic
Circles.</p>

<p>Now, to offset the above mentioned qualifications,
I may lack a few Social ones, but what I lacked in
knowledge I could make up in tact. I would not
at any dinner pick up a single weapon until I saw
what the Hostess was going to operate with first.
When in doubt, tell a funny story till you see what
the other fellow is going to do.</p>

<p>Then, of course, any glaring error on my part
would be laid onto the customs of my Country
and not on me personally.</p>

<p>Then I have an economy measure to recommend
me. The Government is putting into commission
the Leviathan, our biggest Ship, and I could, by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</span>
entertaining on the Boat going over, save passage
fee. I could arrange a Monologue on, “The Benefits
and Accomplishments of Prohibition,” and, as
we passed the three mile limit, I could start in
delivering it and perhaps relieve, or rather add to,
the dryness of the trip. We would have to explain
this to the Farmers of the country so they would
not think the ship was getting this feature for nothing.
It could not be considered as Ship Subsidy.</p>

<p>Now the feature that I feel rather modest about
referring to, but which is really my principal asset,
is my being able to wear Silk Knee Breeches—not
only wear them, but what I mean, look like something
in them.</p>

<p>It seems that the Lord instead of distributing my
very few good points around as he does on most
homely men, why, he just placed all of mine from
the knee down. Now that this thing has come over
there, it almost seems like I was inspired for the
part. Say, I can put on those silk Rompers and clean
up. Now I don’t like to grab off a Guy’s job by
knocking him, but you know we haven’t had a decent
looking leg over there in years. Now Harvey’s!
Oh, but what’s the use of arguing? You know you
can’t stay in the Follies 7 years on nothing. Well, it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</span>
wasn’t my good looks. So what was it but my
Shape?</p>

<p>That brings us down to Golf. Now I will have
to admit that my political education has been sadly
neglected as I have never walked over many green
pastures. Horses are too cheap for a man to spend
half his life walking over the country looking for
holes in the ground. But as I understand this lack
of Golf will not handicap me in England as it would
over here, as Mr. Volstead has not percolated into
that land and the game is still fought out at the 19th
hole. And, if I do say it myself, I do talk a corking
Game of Golf. Then another thing, in looking over
the results of the last two International Golf Tournaments
I don’t think they play the game there at
all.</p>

<p>Now, Mr. President, if this suggestion receives
the consideration that I think it deserves, I should
like to get the appointment at once, as I want to get
over there before all the king’s Children are married.
If one can’t attend a royal marriage, why,
their ambassadorship has been a failure as far as
publicity is concerned for that event is the World’s
Series of England.</p>

<p>Now, if you can’t send me there, don’t, just because<span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</span>
I have criticized some of the feminine members
of official life in Washington, don’t, for the Lord’s
sake, send me to Chile or Honduras or some of the
outlandish places. I will even promise to hush rather
than that.</p>

<p>Now, as to Salary, I will do just the same as the
rest of the Politicians—accept a small salary as pin
Money, AND TAKE A CHANCE ON WHAT I
CAN GET.</p>

<p>
Awaiting an early reply, I remain</p>

<p class="author">
Yours faithfully,<br>
<span class="smcap">Will Rogers</span>.<br>
</p>

<p>P.S. If you don’t want me, Turkey wants me to
represent them in Washington. So where would you
rather have me—in England or Washington?</p>

<p>As I am writing this away out here in California
days before you read it, it’s Sunday and
everybody’s thoughts and sympathies are
with a train rushing clear across our Country, passing
sorrowfully through little Towns with Just Folks
standing bareheaded paying their respects to Just
Folks going back to Marion to stay with Just Folks.</p>

<p>He goes to his resting place a Martyr, a martyr
to the Boneheadedness of Reception Committees.
You wouldn’t ask your hired man to do in one week
the amount of real physical work that each Committee
asked him to do on one day. Imagine three long
Speeches in one day in Seattle at different places,
and Parade for two hours in the hot Sun with his
hat off most of the time, besides a thousand other
things he was asked to do.</p>

<p>Just suppose for instance you had a Guest coming
to visit you. Would you start in having him entertain
the Neighbors the minute he got in the House,
and then keep every minute of his time occupied till
train time, and then turn him over to the next bunch?<span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</span>
Why, no, you wouldn’t think of such a thing. The
first thing you think of when a friend comes from a
long Journey is to have him rest, but because it is
your President he don’t need any. So when the next
Congress meets they should pass a law to shoot all
Reception Committees, or teach them consideration
for other People.</p>

<p>If Jack Dempsey had left Washington and undertaken
this same strain, when he got back Uncle Joe
Cannon could have licked him.</p>

<p>Any of you who have slept, or tried to, on a Train
at Night and got into a Town early in the morning,
you know you don’t feel like speaking or Parading.
You want to go to a Hotel and go to bed. Now
can you imagine the President’s case? Every morning
at 6 A. M. to be awakened by a Band (it
wouldn’t be so bad if it was a good Band) and you
look out and there is the Town’s best Citizens in
Antique Hats, ready to show you the Fire House,
the new Aqueduct, the High School, and City Hall.
The smell of the Moth Balls from the long tail
Coats of the Committee morning after morning,
would give a man some kind of disease.</p>

<p>Now, every man on that Committee was nearly
tired out at night and took a vacation the next day,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</span>
but the President must go right on the same thing
the next day, only worse, for every Town was trying
to outdo the other. It’s not only a hardship on the
People you are entertaining but hard on everybody
participating.</p>

<p>One Town will have a Flag composed of 5 thousand
children, assembled and standing in the Hot
sun for hours, not only spoiling their whole day but
subjecting them to every known contagious disease.
The next Town to be original will get 10 thousand
Children to make up their Flag, and Make Their
Parade 10 Miles as the Last One Only Paraded 5,
even if they have to exhaust their Guest to do it.</p>

<p>Then, of course, he is always asked to speak out
in the open. They have 60 acre Fields and put seats
around them and call ’em Stadiums, and expect a
man to talk in them. Anyone who has ever spoken
outdoors knows what outdoor speaking does to your
voice. The Town with the cheapest land and most
Concrete can have the largest Stadium.</p>

<p>I have always claimed that Parades should be
classed as a Nuisance and participants should be
subject to a term in prison. They stop more work,
inconvenience more People, stop more traffic, cause
more accidents, entail more expense, and commit<span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</span>
and cause I don’t remember the other hundred misdemeanors.
And what good are they? Half of
them going along you don’t know who they are, or
what they are for. Even the People in them hate
’em. The most popular joke I had after the War in
New York when the Boys were coming back and
parading every day was, “If we really wanted to
honor our Boys, why didn’t we let them sit on the
reviewing stands and make the people march those
15 miles?” They didn’t want to parade, they
wanted to go home and rest. But they wouldn’t discharge
a Soldier as long as they could find a new
Street in a Town that he hadn’t marched down, yet.</p>

<p>Of course, keep Circus Parades, for they really
give enjoyment not only to kids but us old ones, too.
As a remedy for this parading I would suggest that
each Town set aside one Street, away out where
there is nothing to interfere and give them that as
Parade Street; then when some fellow or gang wants
to try out a new Uniform or honor somebody, why
let them parade up and down there just as long as
they want to. If you think Parading is popular just
see how many would go over there to see it. Parades
nowadays think they are drawing a crowd
when it’s only people trying to get across the street<span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</span>
to their business, not to see you Parade at all. So
just set them aside a Street—that will stop it. The
minute a Parader sees that no one is watching him he
will stop and in that way you will eliminate all
Parades.</p>

<p>I was on the Reception Committee of the Movie
Industry that was to have met the President here in
Los Angeles. Well, just as an example of what I
said about the others, they decided that it might be
showing partiality if they took him to any one Studio,
so they decided to take him to all of them. In that
way they could take up his entire time. Now, no
one knew whether he wanted to go to any of them
or not; we were deciding for him. Can you imagine
being a Guest of the City of Carnegie, Pa., and the
Committee showing you through all the Steel mills
in Town?</p>

<p>Now, President Harding was quite an admirer of
the Movies so I imagine he liked sausage, too. But
Chicago didn’t rush him off to the Packing Houses
the minute he got there, to see it made.</p>

<p>According to his itinerary here, he was allowed
15 minutes to call on an Aunt whom he hadn’t seen
in years that lived here. That was to be his only
relaxation while here. We were waiting to see how<span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</span>
long Frisco’s Parade would run so we could run
ours longer.</p>

<p>Now, as just an example of the trip, he loved
Golf (and as the later sad events have proven) it was
good for him; it was the very Recreation needed.
But do you think these Committees let him do it?
No Sir, he only got out three times on the entire
trip. I offered a suggestion here when they were
making the arrangements, but like everything coming
from a Comedian it was considered not practical.
I wanted to let the Reception Committee go
ahead and rent the Suits and be at the Station looking
Funny just like these others he was used to day
after day, but instead of dragging him off where he
didn’t know where he was going, why just say, “Mr.
President, we have engaged a room at the Central
Hotel. Here’s a Ford Car at your disposal. Here’s
a Card to any Golf Course in our Town. Now we
know you are tired, so you just make yourself at
home these few days; do just as you please, we have
no plans for you at all.”</p>

<p>Well, my plan wasn’t adopted; it was too late.
But if it had been even partly tried in all the Towns
on this trip we would have all been happy and had
him with us today. The first Town that ever does<span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</span>
do that with their visiting Guests and treat them as
if Human, they will soon be wondering where all
their popularity comes from.</p>

<p>You may have read in the Papers last year that
the Diplomatic Relations were strained between
President Harding and some of my Jokes on the
Administration. Now, I want to say that nothing
was farther from the truth. That was simply newspaper
stuff. It was reported that he couldn’t stand
Jokes about the Administration. Why, he had a
great sense of Humor and could stand all the jokes
ever told about him or his Policies. The first time I
met him Will Hays introduced me to him in the
White House and he repeated to me a lot of jokes
that I had told away before.</p>

<p>And I told him then: “Now Mr. Harding, I
don’t want you to think I am hard on you—all.
You know I told some pretty hard ones on the Democrats
when they were in; in fact I think I told funnier
ones on the Democrats, as they were doing funnier
things.” I explained to him that it would not be
fair to the Democrats to kid them while they were
down, but the minute they get their head above
Water again I will take a whack at them.</p>

<p>I met Will Hays just before I left New York in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</span>
June and he said, “Will, I had lunch with the President
last week and he had me tell him all your new
stuff on the Administration.”</p>

<p>No, I don’t think I ever hurt any man’s feelings
by my little gags. I know I never wilfully did it.
When I have to do that to make a living I will quit.
I may not have always said just what they would
have liked me to say but they knew it was meant in
good nature.</p>

<p>I never go to Detroit that I don’t spend an entire
day out with Henry Ford and I don’t suppose there
is a man living (barring the owners) that have told
any more jokes on him than I have.</p>

<p>I liked President Harding. You see I had met
him, and I don’t believe any man could meet him
and talk to him and not like him. Why, I said after
first meeting him, “I thought I would be scared when
they took me in but he made me feel just like talking
to some good old prosperous Ranchman out home.”
That’s why I can understand him wanting to meet
as many people personally as possible, for to meet
him meant another friend.</p>

<p>I only hope our Future Presidents can be gifted
with his Sense of Humor and Justice.</p>

<p>He was a mighty good friend to us Theatrical<span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</span>
People; he was a good friend to ALL kinds of
People.</p>

<p>For he had the right dope after all. Everybody
is JUST FOLKS.</p>

<p>HE WAS A REAL HONEST-TO-GOD-MAN.</p>

<p>The <i>Illiterate Digest</i> is a weekly publication,
devoted to straight reading matter. We
have no picture section and I doubt if we
will appeal to over 1%, of the Public as the success
of a Publication is based nowadays on the
amount of Pictures and Advertising that they have
in them. Of course, all our news comes by Radio.
But The Digest is a tried and operating Paper.
In fact we are old timers in the field. This is our
4th issue and we have just bought out and combined
The Weekly Blowout, a paper that was
sponsoring Mr. Ford’s Detour to the White House.
After his famous announcement that 90 per cent
of the People in this Country were satisfied, why,
The Blowout couldn’t withstand such untruth. Had
Mr. Ford gone through and been elected why The
Blowout would have become the mouthpiece of the
Administration. So, while not crowing over the misfortune
of a Competitor, we were able to procure
the Title of said Paper as soon as it had lost the
chances of getting our Government run as Mr. Ford<span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</span>
would have run it on a “Tighten a Bolt as it Goes
By” system. Now The Digest and Blowout combined,
is looking for some other likely Candidate
to boost. We have even got down to such sore
straits that a Populist would not be overlooked.</p>

<p>The Digest has some real inside Hollywood
dirt to dish up to you. For fear some
competitor will get in and publish it first I will tell
just what happened at a Wild Party that was given
tonight at the home of the Editor of this very Gem
of Truth. And what makes it worse the head of our
Industry that was hired and supposed to keep the
Scandal from our doorsteps, was the main Guest,
Will Hays (the only man in the history of Industry
that was ever hired for a job without him
or the People that hired him knowing what he was
hired for, yet still made so good they couldn’t replace
him). Will Hays, the man who made Harding
President, and the Movies (partly) behave.</p>

<p>Well my Wife and I, aided and encouraged by
Daughter Mary decided to put on a Wild Party.
Hollywood had been getting all the Publicity and
selling all the Real Estate through their Scandal,
and here was Beverly Hills who could put it on
just as Wild as they could, and we couldn’t seem<span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</span>
to get anywhere. So we looked around to find some
Guest that would be well enough known, so that
when we carried him home he would be recognized.</p>

<p>We thought of Will Hays. So about 6.30 P. M.
who should come staggering in from across the
street from the Hotel but our Guest. His brother
was to have come with him, but the Brother is a
Lawyer from Sullivan, Indiana, and not having had
the experience and capacity of Will he had gone
completely out earlier in the evening while being
entertained by The Womans’ Federation of
Churches.</p>

<p>Well, Will was so loaded that he had on a dress
suit. It was the first one that had ever been in our
House, so Bill Jr. and Jim, who had just come in
from Public School and refilled their Flasks commenced
to laugh at the Suit, and we put a sheet
over the Chairs so that he wouldn’t get it dirty.</p>

<p>But by this time he was feeling so good he didn’t
care anyway, for the Industry had bought it for
him—and about this time another Guest who lives
right near fell into the door before we knew it.
That was Miss Pauline Frederick.</p>

<p>She was all primed for a real old prolonged
Rough House. She had brought the stuff along with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</span>
her. She had under her arm a big bag of knitting.
She was knitting a Blanket for one of my Polo
Ponies. So we all staggered around there till one of
the children thought of introducing Miss Frederick
and Will.</p>

<p>Then, to make the Party real devilish I was to go
and get another man’s wife while he was away at
work. She lived next door, so I sneaked out while
my Wife wasn’t looking and dashed right into the
home of the young Mrs. Cornelius Vanderbilt Jrs.
She slipped on something and we both complimented
each other on account of her Husband having to be
at the office getting out his Newspaper. She asked
if the Party was to be so wild that she should take
her Gun. I said, “Sure, let’s do it right.” So we
blew back just as they are ready to get real wild
and start eating.</p>

<p>By this time Jim and Bill are becoming reconciled
to Hays’ suit and start playing Baseball in the
House. Hollywood can’t put on anything wilder
than that. Hays by this time is feeling so good he
is telling a story complimenting a Democrat.</p>

<p>We all start off with a Fruit Cocktail and everybody
commenced to loosen up and tell their right
Salaries. Then comes some Consomme and I can<span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</span>
tell you this old mixing of drinks is getting in its
work. Daughter Mary started doing a Wild dance
in the Living Room until Jim laid her out with a
Baseball Bat. Then Hays got to telling what his
Boy could do, and the party just went from one
Debauch into another.</p>

<p>Will told us of his trip to England with Ambassador
Harvey. He said he went for pleasure, and I
tried to get him to really tell what he went for.
I think it was to get the Prince of Wales to come
out for Coolidge.</p>

<p>Between drinks of Broiled Chicken I tried to
find out if he was going to be the Campaign Manager
for Mr. Coolidge. But he seemed to think
it was such a sure fire thing, that they would waste
some less expensive man. I kinder sobered up for
a minute and asked him what he thought they would
do in this investigation into the Tea Pot Dome Oil
Lease. He said he didn’t think they could show
where Sinclair ever gave Sectry Fall anything. He
knew Sinclair was too smooth a giver for that.</p>

<p>I asked him what he thinks of us sending Warships
to Mexico. So he tells me what a hard time
they had getting down there. Washington wired
to the nearest one to go down and it runs on the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</span>
rocks before they got through reading the telegram.
You know our Navigators now depend on
Radio to tell them where they are.</p>

<p>The Navy hasn’t had a Compass in three years.
They start on a trip and the radio operator tunes
in and gets Paul Whiteman’s Orchestra playing
somewhere, and when he comes to he is in a lifeboat.
Bedtime stories have put 9 ships to sleep.</p>

<p>Then I asked him who we were going to protect
down there, he said, why the Oil Men. I asked
him who protects the Mexican Sheep Herder in
this Country if somebody interferes with his Industry,
and if Mexico had a Navy could she send it
up here to protect him. He said No. So the moral
of this is, Be an Oil Man not a Sheep Herder,
and be sure to be born in a Country that has a
Navy.</p>

<p>By this time we are all so full we have to leave
the table, and the noise of moving chairs is something
deafening.</p>

<p>It’s now eight thirty and the neighbors can see
the light in our house and begin to phone in about
it to the Police. Miss Fredericks’ Yarn runs out,
and she begins to yawn. Jim, Mary and Bill being
younger and less unaccustomed to the revelry, had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</span>
to be literally carried to their beds. Scandal was
running rampant, while my wife was getting them
off. That left Bill and I with the two Women. I
says, “What will we do, Bill,” and he says, “Oh, I
am in for anything.” So I just up and said, “Let’s
go down to the barn and look at the Horses.” So
out we staggered at 9 o’clock in the night in the heart
of Beverly Hills. Bill Hays, a man that is a leader
in the Presbyterian Church—but it only shows you
when this old Movie Spirit gets in you, you will do
anything.</p>

<p>I lasso four or five horses and bring them out
and show them to Bill, but he is all excited talking
to the Ladies. They wanted to take a ride, but
I didn’t want to carry this thing too far. So we
go back to the house and I finally get them into
their Coats and Hats and walk them home.</p>

<p>My Wife and I we figure the walk will do them
good. So when we come back and get in the
house why it’s actually 9:15.</p>

<p>So I hope by the aid of Bill to put old Beverley
Hills on the map as a Wild Town. Bill says to
me, “Will, if the Woman’s Club ever finds this out
they will stop your pictures”. I says “That’s a good<span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</span>
joke on the Woman’s Club, my Pictures have never
started.”</p>

<p>I know all the papers will have this so I just
want to beat them to it.</p>

</div>


<p>Now I am not going to tell you any jokes
today as jokes are not good for you to
read every day. You will have to look to
the Washington dispatches from Congress for your
humor.</p>

<p>A Comedian is not supposed to be serious nor to
know much. As long as he is silly enough to get
laughs, why, people let it go at that. But I claim
you have to have a serious streak in you or you
can’t see the funny side in the other fellow. Last
Sunday night a Young Girl who had made a big hit
in the Salvation Army preaching on the Street in
New York, decided to go out and give religious
Lectures of her own. So on her first appearance I
was asked by her to introduce her. She said she
would rather have me than a Preacher, or a Politician,
or any one else. Well, I could understand
being picked in preference to a Politician, as that is
one Class us Comedians have it on for public respect,
but to be chosen in preference to a Preacher
was something new and novel.</p>

<p>The meeting was held in a Theatre, as you have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</span>
to fool some New Yorkers to get them in to hear a
Sermon. Well, it took no great stretch of imagination
to say something good for the Salvation
Army, which, by the way, lots of People think was
made by the late war. Why, the Salvation Army
was just as great 10 years ago as it is today—not so
big, but just as great. Ask any down-and-out fellow
and he will tell you he knew of the good of the Salvation
Army long before he ever heard there was a
Kaiser.</p>

<p>Well, it seems like a Coincidence that, as I was
trying to say something in a serious way for the first
time before a New York Audience, why, away out
in Butte, Montana, the best friend I have was going
up to a Minister with a Bible in his hand and asking
him if he didn’t think “the Lord would recognize a
Comedian.”</p>

<p>So that is why you will get this Story and no jokes
today.</p>

<p>Now a great many people, knowing my regard
and friendship for Fred Stone, asked me if I was
surprised. No, I was not. It was the shortest jump,
from his life to a religious one, that any man ever
made.</p>

<p>But it was a BIG thing to do, and I am certainly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</span>
pleased that he did it, for it will have a tremendous
influence for good, not only on the people of our
profession but on every one who reads about it.
When you consider that the biggest and highest
salaried and busiest Man we have in our profession
can stop and give some of his time to religion, it is
a lesson to the rest of us. Now, it has been my good
fortune to have been very close friends with Fred
for years. I have lived in his home and spend all
my spare time there while playing in New York.
We Rope and Ride and play together all the time.
He has two wonderful homes on Long Island, one
all fixed up like a Western Ranch with lots of Horses
and a Polo field of his own on his place.</p>

<p>Then I am asked why he did this do I suppose.
He did it because from childhood he had been raised
up by the Dearest old Mother and Father you ever
saw. That Christian teaching which she put into his
head as a little Kid, when he started out doing a
Tight Rope walking act in a little Circus, is just
coming out. He was brought up to do right and
never knew anything else. Just to watch him with
his Mother and Father today you will understand
he didn’t have to go far to see a Preacher.</p>

<p>Then he has the most ideal home life. His every<span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</span>
thought is for his Family. His Wife is of the profession,
and I have often heard my Wife say that
Mrs. Stone is the most wonderful and devoted
Mother she ever saw (and Women have a way of
knowing those things).</p>

<p>And three lovely Daughters, the oldest, Dorothy,
18, who is with him in his show and is as talented
as her Father and Mother. And so are the others.
All are being trained for a Stage career. So you
see he don’t think so bad of the Stage.</p>

<p>He is the best loved Actor on the Stage today.
He plays to the highest type audience of any Musical
Show. He is the only Musical comedy comedian
that has Matinees packed with Children, for none
of our other Musical Comedy Comedians has ever
been able to please the Children and the grown ups
too. He is as great a Pantomimist on the stage as
Chaplin is on the screen.</p>

<p>Now, people must not get the idea that this is a
remote case in our Business. It is, of course, on
account of the prominence of the man that we have
heard so much of it, and if he had known that it
would be broadcasted in this way it would have been
the only thing to make him hesitate. No one can
say that Fred Stone was ever a publicity seeker. He<span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</span>
is too sincere in all he does for that. I think if all
Churches in communities where Theatrical people
live were canvassed you would find there are as many
of them in attendance as any other line of people.
And when you come to Charity and trying to help
some one who is in need, you will find them, not only
holding their own, but far in the lead of any other
class.</p>

<p>This could not have come at a more opportune
time as Preachers all over are telling us that there
is a gradual weaning away from the Church. If
this will only make people think just for a little it
will have done worlds of good.</p>

<p>I have sometimes wondered if the Preachers themselves
have not something to do with this. You
hear or read a sermon nowadays and the biggest
part of it is taken up by knocking or trying to prove
the falseness of some other denomination. They
say that the Catholics are Damned, that the Jews’
religion is all wrong, or that the Christian Scientists
are a fake, or that the Protestants are all out of
step.</p>

<p>Now just suppose, for a change, they preached to
you about the Lord and not about the other fellow’s
Church, for every man’s religion is good. There is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</span>
none of it bad. We are all trying to arrive at
the same place according to our own conscience
and teachings. It don’t matter which Road you
take.</p>

<p>Suppose you heard a Preacher say, “I don’t care
if you join my Church or the other fellow’s across
the street. I don’t claim mine to be better or worse
than any other. But get with somebody and try
and do better.” Hunt out and talk about the good
that is in the other fellow’s Church, not the bad, and
you will do away with all this religious hatred you
hear so much of nowadays. Then you will not
only have one Fred Stone but Millions of them.</p>

<p>Besides, it’s not that we need more people just to
join Churches. It’s that we need more Fred Stones,
either in or out of a Church. For this Man’s life is
an object lesson to every Young Man or Boy starting
out on a career in any line of business. Sincerity
put him where he is. He never faked. No man his
age in America has worked harder and been more
conscientious.</p>

<p>Another coincidence that happened applies directly
to this case. I was called on to testify in Court if I
thought a certain Team of Popular performers were
UNIQUE AND EXTRAORDINARY. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</span>
whole case was based on those two words. Now
those two words mean a terrible lot. They mean
you must do something that no one else can do. So,
regardless of the popularity of the two performers
and with all due regard for all that others can do, I
said they were not.</p>

<p>And I claim that the only one I know of in our
entire profession who I could rightly claim was
unique and Extraordinary is this man that went into
a store and asked for a Bible. Went out and studied
it according to his best knowledge. (Which, by the
way, is not so much as Book learning goes. As Fred
and I have figured up once. He got as far as the
fourth reader while I only reached the third. So
that is why I think we always hit it off together so
well, neither was liable to use a word which the
other couldn’t understand.)</p>

<p>Fred Stone can do more things and do them well
than any man in or out of the Show Business or the
Movies.</p>

<p>Why can he?</p>

<p>He is 49 years old and has spent 45 years practicing.
Now, we have not another man in America
that has done that. He started at 4 or 5 years of
age and has worked on new stunts every day of his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</span>
life and still does. He always wanted to have something
new for the people every year. We have performers
that have specialized on one thing that are
great, but not a one that can do the variety of things
that he can. And the wonderful part is it is clean
wholesome entertainment that you are glad to have
your children see. So the clean does pay after all
in any line of business.</p>

<p>He was the originator of the present style of eccentric
Dancing on the Stage. In his dances he
dances not only with his feet but also his Body and
face show you what he is trying to convey. The
greatest compliment I ever heard paid a dancer was
said about him by another great dancer, “Why Fred
Stone can dance in a Barrel where you can’t see his
feet and still be a greater dancer to look at than the
rest of them out of one.”</p>

<p>A corking good all-around Acrobat. He practiced
for years just to get a perfect One Hand
Stand and never used it—just wanted to learn it.
He is one of the best Actor Ball Players. Boxed
for years with Corbett, who has always said that
Fred could have been Champion at his weight.</p>

<p>Here’s a little tip for you, too. He can lick
more men single handed, if they start something
with him, than can any Hero in the Movies where
they are trained to fall.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</span></p>
<figure class="figcenter illowp65" id="i211" style="max-width: 44.75em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/i211.jpg" alt="">
  <figcaption class="caption">IF A RIDER HIT ON HIS HEAD, IT WAS ME.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</span></p>
<p>He took up Fancy Rope throwing after he was
37 years old and today there are not a half dozen
Boys in this Country that can do more tricks than
he can. He learned in 12 years what it’s taken
me 40 to learn. Hired Rinks to stay open after
their seasons closed and paid Instructors for three
years to perfect him in fancy Ice Skating. He
learned Bareback Riding for a Circus Act, and
every kind of Wild West trick riding. Bucking
Horses he learned to ride after he was 43, just
when at that age most Riders are quitting. He
Bull Dogged a Steer at Cheyenne and had never
done it before in his life. Now that takes nerve.
I wouldn’t jump off a horse on a steer even if he
promised to lay down. He is a good Polo Player;
we had a team composed of the late Vernon Castle,
who, by the way was a good Horseman and a nervy
fellow, Leo Corrello, Fred and Myself. Well, in
our Clown games we all took it as a joke, but Fred
took it serious. He wanted to know the thing from
every angle.</p>

<p>Now to me I didn’t care whether I hit the Ball
or not. I knew it would be laying there when I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</span>
come back. But not so with Fred. Well, there
was a lot of falls and spills. The audience who
watched us play every Sunday got to learn that in
a spill if the falling Rider hit on his feet it was
Fred Stone. If he hit on his head it was me. We
would both be equally safe.</p>

<p>He is one of the best shots in the Country, has
practiced for years with Annie Oakley, the Greatest
shot this Country ever saw. He hunted big Game
with his Brother-in-Law, Rex Beach, in Alaska.
Went to Greenland to Lassoo, not shoot, Polar
Bears, hunted Mountain Lions in Arizona, and
Bears wherever he could hear of one.</p>

<p>Now that he has taken up religion and the Bible,
he wont have to ask a Preacher to advise him
long. Preachers will be coming to him, for he don’t
half do anything. So when he comes back, and
Sunday comes, and I go down to Rope and Ride
and play, if he wants to knock off and go to Church
I don’t think I will mind, and if they will let ME
in, I may go too.</p>

<p>The <i>Illiterate Digest</i> has devoted its life
work to ferreting out the Persons and
things in our National affairs which are
not just exactly up to snuff. Now I see where the
Senate Investigating Committee has called a recess
for 10 days. Scandals were unfolding themselves so
fast that the Committee couldn’t get one Bribe
straight in their minds before another one would bob
up. So they retired to kinder see where they were at.</p>

<p>Now, while that committee may be resting, the
<i>Illiterate Digest</i> never rests; we are on the heels
of the evildoer 24 hours of every bribing day. I
hope by the time this reaches an eager waiting Public
that they will have found two Lawyers to conduct
this Oil investigation. Just think, America has one
hundred and ten million population, 90 percent of
which are Lawyers, yet we can’t find two of them
who have not worked at some time or another for
an Oil company. There has been at least one lawyer
engaged for every barrel of Oil that ever come
out of the ground.</p>

<p>You might wonder if they pay so much to Lawyers<span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</span>
how do they ever make anything out of the Oil?
Foolish question. They don’t make anything out
of the Oil. They only make money out of the stock
they sell. You buy a share of oil stock and for
every dollar you pay, 60 percent goes for Lawyers’
fees, 30 percent to over Capitalization, and 10 percent
goes to the boring of a Dry Hole.</p>

<p>If a Company just put down Wells for Oil, and
then sold the oil legitimately, they would have no
use at all for Lawyers. But Oil Men engage their
Lawyers nowadays even before they have leased
the land or know where they are going to prospect.
For the lawyer has to make the lease. It’s not like
any other business where the owner and the man
who is going to lease can meet and do business.
Oh no, Lawyers must do that. Then, if they happen
to be leasing from the Government, why they
not only have to be Lawyers but have to be Political
Lawyers.</p>

<p>Now, I bet a lot of you thought after the Company
had got the land leased, that the next thing
to do was to hire a Driller to put the Well down.
But you are wrong again. You go out and get another
Lawyer. You have to have another Lawyer
to draw up the contract with the driller.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</span></p>

<figure class="figcenter illowp62" id="i219" style="max-width: 44.75em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/i219.jpg" alt="">
  <figcaption class="caption">THEY NOT ONLY HAVE TO BE LAWYERS, BUT POLITICAL 
LAWYERS.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</span></p>

<p>Then I bet that you think the next step is to wait
until you see whether you have Oil or not. Say,
don’t make me laugh out loud again. You don’t
wait for anything of the kind: you engage another
Lawyer to draw up some pretty Oil Stock Paper
with nice flowered edges. Looks like a marriage
license—only worse. Then you start selling the
stock, claiming that the BoHunk Oil Company are
putting down a Well on Smith 29, North East 40
of South West 80. Then if they do strike something,
they shut it up and claim it was a Duster.</p>

<p>Then they get another Local Lawyer who knows
everybody around that neck of the Woods, to go
out and buy up or lease all the adjoining land.
Then, when they get it all leased, they go back and
pick the stopper out of this. Well, double the Capitalization
of Stock under the direction of still another
Lawyer, and then they are in a position to
hire more Lawyers to investigate getting a Lease
from Persia, or Jugo-Slavia. This just kinder gives
you a rough idea of what all these Lawyers do and
why we can’t get any to help prosecute this Oil
Scream.</p>

<p>The <i>Illiterate Digest</i> will have to take Editorial
attention of the resignation of Sectry Denby. Mr.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</span>
Denby was requested by the Senate to resign. Now
that in itself is a mighty good Omen that he is
an unusually able man. Of course, where I think
he got in bad was in saying, if he had the same
thing to do over again he would do it. It is always
bad for any one on trial to say he would do the
same thing over again. American People like to
have you repent; then they are generous.</p>

<p>But you see lots of times a man gets in wrong
just by an ill timed remark. Look at Mr. Doheny’s
reported remark that he would “make 100 million
out of the Elk Hills lease.” That will go down
in History as the highest priced Gag ever pulled.
That’s why Mr. Coolidge never gets in bad. If a
man will just stay hushed he is hard to find out.</p>

<p>Personally and Editorially, I don’t think Mr.
Denby is guilty at all of any wrong-doing that he
knew of. But somebody has got to go in this
thing, and before it’s all over you are mighty apt
to find a few innocent along with all the guilty
strewn along by the Pipe Line.</p>

<p>By the way, sometime this Country, just by accident,
is going to get some man Sectry of the
Navy who has at least received a Picture Post Card
of Annapolis, sometime during his career. Josephus<span class="pagenum" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</span>
Daniels had never been in anything bigger than a
Row Boat up to the time he was made Sectry of
the Navy. The first Battleship he got on he kept
looking for the Paddle Wheels on the side that
made it go. He found the Officers in those days
had Cocktail and Cordial Glasses with their Table
wear. He made them throw them all overboard.
He thought they would sink the Ship. What he
lacked in seamanship, he made up in morality.</p>

<p>Then came Mr. Denby who had received his
Maritime Education by looking at the Detroit
River (which is so thick with Booze Boats that
you can’t see the Water) naturally his Aquatic viewpoint
is rather warped.</p>

<p>I guess Young Theodore Roosevelt comes nearer
being an Old Salt than anyone connected with our
Ex Oil Owners (The Navy). He did live in Oyster
Bay overlooking Long Island Sound, and had to
look at the Joy Line cruising, 1$ daily, to Providence.
Then he had to Subway under the East
River to get to New York. So I guess he is the
only Sectry we have that knows just by looking at
one, which end of a Battleship is the front.</p>

<p>Judging by the previous experience of some of
our sectrys, of various things in our Cabinets, it has<span class="pagenum" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</span>
always been a source of great anxiety to me just
why a Vetenerian has never been appointed either
Sectry of War or PostMaster General.</p>

<p>Now by the time this reaches our Scandal loving
Public I don’t know who will be left in Washington.
The chances are, when I visit the old stamping
ground again, I will have to make entirely new
acquaintances. But I will always have the feeling,
“Well the old Boys were not so bad. They were
just unfortunate in getting caught.”</p>

<p>It certainly looks like a tough year. Politicians
are so busy trying to hold down their own Jobs
that they won’t have any time to look out for anyone
else. They will be voting a Bonus to men who
lost their livelihood in the great morality Panic of
1924.</p>

<p>Children in future years will ask their Parents,
“Father how much did you get in the great Year
1924?”</p>

<p>It’s been a fine thing for Washington. The Hotels
are crowded. Every time a Guest registers the
Clerk asks him, “I suppose you will be here until
you testify.” It’s a bigger thing for Washington
than the Shriners’ Convention, because it has all of
them, besides a lot more.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</span></p>

<p>If they would all tell the truth the first time they
testify they wouldn’t have to testify again like they
are doing now, and they would get the thing over
a lot quicker. They ought to pass a rule in this
Country that in any investigations, if a Man couldn’t
tell the truth the first time he shouldn’t be allowed
to try again.</p>

<p>Now we have another Scandal in the Veterans’
Bureau. But we are just in such shape that we
can’t take care of but one Scandal at a time. If
any other small affairs come up during the coming
season that look like they might develop into a
Scandal I will try to let you know.</p>

<p>I wish this Oil Scandal would hurry up and be
settled as it is very hard for one writing on
affairs of our Country to tell, in writing of
our Officials, whether to speak of them as Secretary
So and So, or Ex-Secretary So and So. Up
to now I claim a very unique distinction. I am the
only Person I know of that has not been mentioned
as receiving something in the nature of a Fee from
some Big Corporation. But I am going to get in
early and tell just what I received so when my
name comes up later on people will say: “Well
there is a Man who has accepted Fees but he was
honest about them and come to the front and told
it.” As I can’t get to Washington to testify I
want to tell through the Digest, for which I am
Scandal Correspondent, just what happened to me.
If I was in Washington I probably couldn’t get to
testify as there is so many ahead of me that it will
take years for just the People who work for the
Government to tell who gave them something.</p>

<p>I know a Man that went to Washington to testify<span class="pagenum" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</span>
as to money he had received and there was 29
Cabinet and Ex Cabinet Members in line ahead of
him so he had to just write it and send it in. Now
this whole thing was a strictly Republican affair
until Mr. Doheny (who never lets Politics interfere
with his Business) appeared before the Commission,
and when it looked like he was the only
Oil be-spattered sheep in the Democratic Fold, he
just kicked over an Oil Can and hiding behind it
were a flock of Democrats that reached almost as
far back as Jefferson’s Administration.</p>

<p>Personally I am glad that he did unearth members
of both Parties for if this thing had gone
through showing no one but Republicans, it would
have cast a reflection on the shrewdness of the Democratic
Party. In other words they would have
looked rather dumb to be standing around with all
these Oily Shekels falling all around them and not
opening their Pockets to catch a few. For the American
people are a very generous people and will
forgive almost any weakness, with the possible exception
of stupidity.</p>

<p>But to get back to my confession for I want to
be set right before the people by the time we meet<span class="pagenum" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</span>
in Madison Square Garden in June to select the
worst man. Mine starts out like a Fairy Story.</p>

<p>Once upon a time, I had just gone to work for
Florenz Ziegfeld, Jr., and was playing in what was
called Ziegfeld’s Midnight Frolic, on the Roof of
the Amsterdam Theatre, New York. Prohibition
and my Jokes were equally responsible in closing the
place up. Now my home is (as I think I mentioned
before) Claremore, Oklahoma, (The home of the
best Curative Waters in the World) and, by the
way, one of the best towns in the World to live in
if any of you are thinking about making a change.</p>

<p>Well, after I had finished my little 15 minutes
of annoyance in the Frolic one night, one of the
Waiters (for instead of having Ushers to hand
you a Programme, they had Waiters to hand you
a drink, and I tell you, you can’t beat some of the
old customs). Well this well tipped Waiter come
to my dressing room, which I used to hang my
ropes in, and said, “There is a Party of folks out
front at one of the Tables from Oklahoma, and
they want you to come out and see them.” I asked
what place in Oklahoma did they come from, and
he said, “I don’t know but they certainly got the
Dough; they have ordered everything in the place<span class="pagenum" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</span>
but the Kitchen Stove.” I said, “They are from
Tulsa. I will be right out.”</p>

<p>Well I hid what few dollars I had down in my
Sock, and went out to see them. It was Mr. Harry
Sinclair. I had never heard of him before, for
he hadn’t bought Zev or the Teapot Dome up to
then. But we soon felt like we knew each other,
on account of him being from Tulsa (a Residential
Suburb of Claremore where we park our millionaires
to keep them from getting under our feet).
He knew my Father who had been a member of
the Constitutional Convention, which drafted the
Charter of Oklahoma.</p>

<p>Well, this Mr. Sinclair was an awful nice fellow.
We hit it off pretty good. We kinder consoled
each other, on account of being so far from home,
and trying to eke out an existence from these shrewd
New Yorkers. He took a fatherly interest in me,
and asked, “Now, Will, you are working here but
what are you doing with your money?” So I told
him just what I was doing with it, that the last
three months’ wages had gone to paying a Doctor
and a Nurse, for assisting us in accumulating another
Baby, and that the three months previous to
that my wages had gone to making the first payment<span class="pagenum" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</span>
on a second hand Overland car, and that the
year still previous to that I had bought a Baby
Buggy and a Victrola.</p>

<p>Well, he seemed mighty pleased that I was putting
my money into such staple commodities. So
I asked him what he was doing with his. He said,
“I struck Oil, but Oil is no good unless its Capitalized.”</p>

<p>Well, that was news to me. I thought you
could just sell the Oil itself. But I learned that
you can get twice as much for the Capital as you
can for the Oil.</p>

<p>So then he asked me the names of my Private
Herd. I told him I had gone to a great deal of
trouble and thought in naming them and after
months of research among pretty and odd names of
Novels and Poems, I had decided to name the Children,
Bill, Mary and Jim.</p>

<p>Well, he had never heard of anything more original.
The names I thought struck him very odd,
as he wrote all three of them down on the back
of an Envelope. So I left the Table as I didn’t
want to be there when the Waiter presented his
check. For I had seen several Casualties from this
same cause.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</span></p>

<p>I never thought much more about it. I went
home and told my Wife about meeting him, and
what do you think happened! In a couple of days
here comes three official letters addressed to Bill,
Mary and Jim, and they had enclosed a Share each
of Sinclair Oil Stock <i>free</i>. Well we thought that
was a mighty fine thing for him to do to be so
thoughtful of our little Tribe. I accepted it in as
good faith as McAdoo did his Fee.</p>

<p>I don’t know if the Senate investigating Committee
will get around to them soon or not. Of
course they will have to get through before Election
for the whole thing will be a total loss after
election. All I have to say is that the Children
were Private Citizens and did not promise to use
any influence in any way. Of course, I, as the
Father and Guardian of the Children, will be apt
to come in for considerable criticism, and I may
go so far as to lose any chance I may have as
being named as a Presidential possibility.</p>

<p>Now I hate this for the Children’s sake that
all this must come out for it is liable to put a stigma
on their names that they will be two Campaigns
living down. One thing, of course, will be in their
favor when it all does come out and that is that it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</span>
was sent openly through the mails. It was not delivered
in a Suit Case.</p>

<p>They have had these shares for years and have
also received at various times a Dollar or so Interest
on said Stock. When this Expose came out
Bill and Mary were for resigning and sending in
their Stock, so they could show that they were not
connected with the Corporation, but Jim, the youngest,
who has a touch of Republicanism in him, why,
he said, “No, let’s stick until they throw us out.
Let them prove we took these Stocks for some other
reason than Charity!”</p>

<p>What makes it look bad is, that my Wife wrote
a note and thanked him. But the children did not
sign the Note. So when he is called upon to testify
he will have her Note but it won’t have the Children’s
Signature on it. Of course he can say it
was tore off, or that his Wife has that part of it,
or some other equally good reason. But I want the
Public to be lenient with both him and the Children,
for as past events have proven they haven’t done
a thing for him to warrant them getting those
Stocks. So I honestly believe he meant no harm
when he gave them.</p>

<p>As for Mr. Doheny giving me or mine anything,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</span>
we live right near him here in Beverly Hills. His
son did promise me a key, so I wouldn’t have to
ride clear around his Estate when out horseback
riding, but I never got it yet.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Senator Walsh</span></p>

<p>Do you work for a Man that runs a Newspaper?</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Mr. Major</span></p>

<p>I draw a salary from him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</span></p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Senator Walsh</span></p>

<p>What right have you to send Telegrams to a
Man in Palm Beach if you are only working for
him?</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Mr. Major</span></p>

<p>I couldn’t get him on the Telephone.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Senator Walsh</span></p>

<p>What did you tell him in your Telegrams?</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Mr. Major</span></p>

<p>What was going on in Washington.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Senator Walsh</span></p>

<p>What did he tell you in his Telegrams to you?</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Mr. Major</span></p>

<p>What was going on in Palm Beach.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Senator Walsh</span></p>

<p>What was going on at the time in Washington?</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Mr. Major</span></p>

<p>Why the Senate Committee was investigating
somebody.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Senator Walsh</span></p>

<p>Who were they investigating?</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Mr. Major</span></p>

<p>They didn’t know themselves.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Senator Walsh</span></p>

<p>What did he say was going on in Palm Beach?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</span></p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Mr. Major</span></p>

<p>I am ashamed to tell you.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Senator Walsh</span></p>

<p>Who were these Telegrams from in Palm Beach?</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Mr. Major</span></p>

<p>I can’t remember.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Senator Walsh</span></p>

<p>Did you lease a Wire from Palm Beach to Washington?</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Mr. Major</span></p>

<p>I can’t remember.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Senator Walsh</span></p>

<p>Why did you lease the Wire?</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Mr. Major</span></p>

<p>So we could say we had a Wire to Palm Beach.
It was good advertising.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Senator Walsh</span></p>

<p>Who operated this wire?</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Mr. Major</span></p>

<p>A Telegraph Operator.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Senator Walsh</span></p>

<p>What was his name?</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Mr. Major</span></p>

<p>I think it was Jones, or Smith; maybe it was
Brown.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</span></p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Senator Walsh</span></p>

<p>Who operated the wire from Palm Beach?</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Mr. Major</span></p>

<p>Johnny.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Senator Walsh</span></p>

<p>Johnny who?</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Mr. Major</span></p>

<p>Johnny Johnnnny.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Senator Walsh</span></p>

<p>Did the operator on this end work at the White
House also?</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Mr. Major</span></p>

<p>Yes he was the Waiter there.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Senator Walsh</span></p>

<p>Did he work there during the Republican or
Democratic Administration?</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Senator Lodge</span></p>

<p>Mr. Committee, I object to that question. This
is not a Partisan affair; I refuse to have the honor
and the glory of the Great Republican Party dragged
into a thing where up to now their fair name has
never been.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Senator Caraway</span></p>

<p>Mr. Committee, I object to the Senator from
Massachusetts’ slurring remarks of the Democratic<span class="pagenum" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</span>
Party; a Party which has housed such illustrious
names as Jefferson, Cleveland, Akron, Youngstown,
Bryan, McAdoo, and sometimes Jim Reed.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Mr. Major</span></p>

<p>Senator Walsh have you got a Cigarette on you?</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Senator Walsh</span></p>

<p>No I just got some cubebs here.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Mr. Major</span></p>

<p>Never mind I will go across the Street and get
some. See you next time I am called.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Senator Walsh</span></p>

<p>Gentlemen, I think the Committee should retire
for a week to consider the Testimony of the Gentleman
who has just testified.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Senator Lenroot</span></p>

<p>But Mr. Chairman, Mr. Doheny’s Yacht is waiting
to take him on a Cruise of the Mediterranean,
and I don’t think it’s fair to keep him waiting.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Senator Wheeler</span></p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I make a motion, that the Committee
make a motion, that Attorney General
Daugherty resign.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Senator Lodge</span></p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I object. His motion is out of
order. I had a motion before the Committee asking<span class="pagenum" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</span>
the Committee asking the Committee to make
a motion, to ask him to stay. Now, by all the rules
of Parliamentary motion making, mine anti-dates
his. And I will stake a Reputation on it that goes
back to the first class Passengers that landed from
that Mother Ship of mine the Mayflower, who have
so gloriously populated the fair state of Massachusetts.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Senator Robinson</span></p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I object. The fair state of
Arkansas houses one direct descendant of that
Plymouth Rock Expedition. And I protest when
the Gentleman from Massachusetts claims the entire
Cargo of that ill-fated Voyage. Never as long
as I represent the majority constituency of my Glorious
state will I stand by and hear the ozone swept
Ozarks spoken of disparagingly, especially by that
Moron State of Massachusetts.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Senator Willis</span></p>

<p>Gentlemen, I don’t think that Mr. Daugherty
should be let out without a trial.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Senator Wheeler</span></p>

<p>Why, he has had three year’s trial already. His
trial is what’s letting him out.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</span></p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Senator Walsh</span></p>

<p>Who will we call next?</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Doortender</span></p>

<p>Why just get a Census return, and call anybody’s
name on it; they are waiting outside.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Senator La Follette</span></p>

<p>Why don’t you call somebody unexpectedly, and
maybe in their confusion they will tell the truth
accidentally.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Senator Lenroot</span></p>

<p>Who said anything about wanting the truth?</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Senator Heflin</span></p>

<p>I want to ask the Committee why they called on
Mr. Fall at his hotel in private.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Senator Walsh</span></p>

<p>We wanted to see where he got the hundred
thousand. We may retire ourselves some day.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Senator Heflin</span></p>

<p>Why didn’t you tell at the time that you went
to see him?</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Senator Walsh</span></p>

<p>Wait a minute, who is running this investigation?
Am I supposed to ask the questions, or to answer
them?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</span></p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Senator Lenroot</span></p>

<p>Where is Sinclair?</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Mr. Zeverly</span></p>

<p class="center">(whose running name is Zev.)</p>

<p>My Client, Mr. Sinclair has gone to the races
and it will be impossible for him to appear until
after the season is over.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Senator Walsh</span></p>

<p>Well how about McLane? Can we get him?</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Senator Caraway</span></p>

<p>You can get him by Telegraph, I guess. Everybody
else has.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Senator Walsh</span></p>

<p>Well, where is Detective William J. Burns? He
was supposed to testify here today.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Doortender</span></p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I met him on the Street and he
couldn’t find the Capitol Building.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Senator Moses</span></p>

<p>I make a motion that we examine the Income
Tax and see what Mr. Doheny contributed to the
Democratic Campaign Fund.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Senator Jim Reed</span></p>

<p>I object. Senator Moses is a Republican and
he is only throwing a smoke Screen to try and hide<span class="pagenum" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</span>
his Party behind it. This is not a Partisan question
and I object to politics being dragged into it
in any way. Let’s handle this thing in a dignified
way, and don’t let Politics play any part. As it
was the Republicans that did it, I am in favor of
justice being served.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Doortender</span></p>

<p>Mr. Forbes is here and wants to testify.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Entire Senate</span></p>

<p>“My Lord, Is he in this, too?”</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Doortender of This Torture Chamber</span></p>

<p>Who will we call first today?</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Senator Walsh</span></p>

<p>Call the Editorial Writer of that newspaper.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Doorman</span></p>

<p>But, Mr. Walsh, we just called him yesterday.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Senator Walsh</span></p>

<p>I know we did but call him again. A whole lot
is happening in this country between yesterday and
today. Now Mr. Bennett who was it that you referred
to as the Principal in those wires to Palm
Beach?</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Mr. Bennett</span></p>

<p>Why, Senator Curtis.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</span></p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Senator Heflin</span></p>

<p>Curses on the Luck. I thought it was Coolidge.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Senator Harrison</span></p>

<p>Wish it had of been Coolidge. It’s no novelty
to get a Senator in Wrong.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Senator Walsh</span></p>

<p>What did you confer with Curtis about?</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Mr. Bennett</span></p>

<p>About the Editorial Policy of our Paper.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Senator Walsh</span></p>

<p>Well what does the Editorial Policy of any Paper
amount to? You don’t suppose anybody reads those
things do you? Why one Ad is worth more to a
paper than 40 Editorials. That will be all for you
Mr. Bennett.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Senator Caraway</span></p>

<p>Just a minute before you go. Who was Peaches
in those Telegrams?</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Mr. Bennett</span></p>

<p>I don’t remember.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Senator Robinson</span></p>

<p>Yes, and who was Prunes? I hope it referred
to no Democrat.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Senator Walsh</span></p>

<p>Call Mr. Curtis.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</span></p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Senator Walsh</span></p>

<p>Senator Curtis, will you tell the Grand Jury in
your own way just what happened between you and
this Editorial Writer of the Washington <i>Post</i>.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Mr. Curtis</span></p>

<p>Yes Sir.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Senator Walsh</span></p>

<p>What was it?</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Mr. Curtis</span></p>

<p>Nothing.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Senator Walsh</span></p>

<p>You mean you didn’t confer with this Gentleman?</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Mr. Curtis</span></p>

<p>I did not.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Senator Walsh</span></p>

<p>But you know him?</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Mr. Curtis</span></p>

<p>Never saw him in my life.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Senator Walsh</span></p>

<p>But you have heard of him?</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Mr. Curtis</span></p>

<p>Never in my life.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Senator Walsh</span></p>

<p>But you know of the Washington <i>Post</i>?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</span></p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Mr. Curtis</span></p>

<p>Yes sir, I have heard it.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Senator Walsh</span></p>

<p>Heard it? What do you mean you heard it?</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Mr. Curtis</span></p>

<p>I have heard Sousa’s Band play it many a time.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Senator Walsh</span></p>

<p>Play what?</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Mr. Curtis</span></p>

<p>Washington’s Post.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Senator Walsh</span></p>

<p>It’s not a tune; it’s a Newspaper. You talk
like a Congressman. Where are you from?</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Mr. Curtis</span></p>

<p>Kansas.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Senator Walsh</span></p>

<p>That will be all.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Senator Caraway</span></p>

<p>Just a minute, Mr. Curtis, Who is Peaches?</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Mr. Curtis</span></p>

<p>I don’t know unless it’s Jim Reed.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Senator Heflin</span></p>

<p>Just a minute. I object to the Republican Senator’s
slur on the fair name of the Democratic Party.
This Investigation is supposed to be Non Sectarian,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</span>
and I object to having Politics dragged in, just to
make a Republican Holiday.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Senator Robinson</span></p>

<p>And I want to know who Prunes was.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Mr. Curtis</span></p>

<p>You mean you want to know who Prunes IS.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Senator Lenroot</span></p>

<p>Mr. Walsh, and Gentlemen of the Vigilance Committee
there is a Bell Boy over at my Hotel and
he just got it from the chauffeur of a Prominent
Oil Man, that Major Leonard Wood’s Son had
just heard that his Father was offered the Nomination
for the Presidency 3 and a Half years ago,
if he would appoint Mr. Jake Hamon Secretary
of the Interior. Now that is a very serious charge,
and one that I think this Committee should look
into at once. Public affairs have come to a fine
Climax when a Man in this Country offers to make
another one President. I tell you it is undermining
the confidence of the Great American People and
when you do that you shake the very Bulwarks of
the American Constitution. I think a Subpœna
should be issued for Mr. Wood’s Son at once and
if this is so I am for a swift and speedy trial for
the Culprits.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_254">[Pg 254]</span></p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Senator Walsh</span></p>

<p>I am for calling Mr. Wood himself. There’s one
thing that this Committee has proven that it won’t
take, and that is Hear Say Evidence. So call Mr.
Wood himself.</p>

<p>But, Mr. Walsh, Mr. Wood is in the Philippines.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Senator Walsh</span></p>

<p>I thought he was home. Haven’t they got their

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Mr. Moses</span></p>

<p>No, Mr. Coolidge wouldn’t give it to them.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Senator Walsh</span></p>

<p>What’s the matter? Have they struck oil, too?</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Mr. Moses</span></p>

<p>No, Mr. Coolidge told them that a Nation that
would not support Wood’s Administration certainly
would not be able to support one of their own.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Senator Heflin</span></p>

<p>Well, how did America get Independence? They

<p>I object to having the President of these United
States’ name dragged into this thing. I think when
a Man occupies the exalted position that he does
that his name should not be degraded by having it
mentioned in The Senate. Now I know that he is
doing the best he can. I have known him ever since
he got prominent enough for me to know. In the
eight months that I have known him, I have found
him to be patient, honest, and a Man who would
not knowingly rob a single Filipino of his Liberty.
This is simply a Political trick to drag his name
into this Philippine muddle.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Senator Heflin</span></p>

<p>Yes but he sent the Filipinos the Wire didn’t he!
And it’s wires that we are here to investigate ain’t
it?</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Senator Harrison</span></p>

<p>Does the exalted Senator from Massachusetts recall
that during the late Democratic Administration,
he himself during the talk on European Affairs mentioned
not only once, but twice, the name of the
then President, Mr. Wilson? Now he don’t want
us to mention his President.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_256">[Pg 256]</span></p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Senator Heflin</span></p>

<p>Well it’s funny to me that a Country can’t get

to have the Champion Bantamweight Prize Fighter

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Senator Walsh</span></p>

<p>Oh, yes, I had forgotten about those. Tell him

to that Oil Lease thing again.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Senator Copeland</span></p>

<p>Mr. Walsh, I was in New York last night and
I heard Mr. Vanderlip make a Speech to the
Rotary Club of Coney Island, and he said, “I have
it on absolutely reliable authority that George Washington
never crossed the Delaware. That fellow
you see in the Picture in the middle of the Boat
was a fellow doubling for him, and if I am called
I will be glad to give this information that I possess
to the Senate Investigating Committee.”</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Senator Walsh</span></p>

<p>Mr. Secretary, call Mr. Vanderlip at once.</p>

</div>


<p>The <i>Illiterate Digest</i>, after reviewing the
news, finds that Politics is sure at the
point when it is about to jell. My old
friend Jim Reed from the smelly banks of the Kaw
River has broke out again. If you have done anything
against the welfare or conventions of the
United States, and everybody has passed their various
opinions on you, and you think you have been
roasted to a dark bay, why, until Jim Reed breaks
out on you, you haven’t been called anything.</p>

<p>Well, it was kinder funny Jim was to make a
Washington Day speech. Naturally everyone supposed
it to be on George Washington, but it was
the only speech ever made on Washington’s Birthday
that didn’t have a word about Washington. He
didn’t even mention his name. I don’t know that
McAdoo, Denby, Daugherty, Doheny, and others
will consider it much Flattery, but it will go down
in History as being the only time they ever replaced
Washington.</p>

<p>Reed wouldn’t have been any good making a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_262">[Pg 262]</span>
speech on Washington, anyway. He would have
been expected to compliment him and I doubt if
he could think of anything George had ever done
that really was worth while.</p>

<p>Vanderlip made a speech at the Rotary Club of
Ossining, New York, that astonished the United
States. Now that speech didn’t astonish me near
as much as the knowledge that Ossining <i>had</i> a Rotary
Club. For the sake of the unfingerprinted ones,
I will state that Ossining is the Town where Sing
Sing is permanently located. Now if Ossining has
a Rotary Club they certainly had to take in some
Lay Members from this Musically named Institution.</p>

<p>But when you come to think of it, just think what
a Distinguished Rotary Club they could have at
that. Rotary is composed of one of the best of each
line of work or business. Just think what a competitive
thing it would be trying to find in Ossining
the leading Burglar sojourning with them at the
time, or the most representative Pickpocket to represent
them in the Club. And Bankers! Mr. Vanderlip
must have felt right at home up there. There
are more Bankers in Ossining than any Town of
its size in the United States.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_263">[Pg 263]</span></p>

<p>A two year residence is necessary to be able to
join the Rotary. Can you imagine them questioning
members of Sing Sing, “Have you been a resident
of this Town for two years?” and the answer would
be, “Yes Sir, constantly.”</p>

<p>So, as I say, it was not the things Mr. Vanderlip
said that attracted the unusual attention. It was
the distinguished audience that he delivered it to.
Just to show you the difference: Appearing before
the Rotary Club of Sing Sing he caused a commotion
by his Speech. He took the same Act down
to Washington and nobody would listen to him. It
shows you have to have an intelligent audience. Up
in Sing Sing they got what he was talking about
but down in Washington it went right over their
heads.</p>

<p>I know, for last winter while playing in New
York I was asked to go over to a big Charity affair
given by the 400 of 5th Avenue. I thought I had
a pretty good line of Gags, as there was quite a lot
happening every day of Public interest. So I go
over and start in telling them what I had read in
the Papers and nobody even cracked a smile, much
less laughed. So I just kept on trying remarks on
every subject that had been in the papers since Bryan<span class="pagenum" id="Page_264">[Pg 264]</span>
last got a Hair cut. But it was about one of the
worst Flops I ever encountered, and I have had
some beauts in my time.</p>

<p>Well, of course, I felt terrible about it, so just by
a coincidence on the very next night I had promised
to go up to Ossining and do an act for (at that
time it wasn’t called the Rotary Club). I think
then they called it Inmates. There was no show—just
me alone went up to add to the hardships of
Prison Life. Well I never knew I had as many
friends in the World. I knew everybody up there.
I was twice as much at home as I had been on
5th Avenue the night before. So now I know why
Vanderlip picked out Ossining for his Annual February
Oration.</p>

<p>I started in on those same Jokes on up-to-date
things that had flopped so completely at the Millionaire’s
Charity affair. Why, say, they just started
right in dying laughing at them. I was sorry Ziegfeld
wasn’t there, as I would have got a raise in
salary if he had heard how my act went. I don’t
care what I talked about they knew all about it.</p>

<p>Ordinarily, I only do about 15 or 20 minutes
but up there I did an Hour and a Quarter. I was
so tickled I offered to take all the whole audience<span class="pagenum" id="Page_265">[Pg 265]</span>
of 12 hundred down to the Follies and pay their
way in to see our Show. Now you know I must
feel pretty good with myself, when I offer to spend
my Dough like that. A lot of people would be
kinder sore at the 400 because they didn’t laugh
like these 12 hundred did, but I am not. I don’t
blame them. If I had their money I wouldn’t read
either. So I can understand very readily why Vanderlip’s
act didn’t go so big in Washington as it did
in Ossining.</p>

<p>Of course Van and I use just the opposite methods
in our Stage performances. Every Gag I tell must
be based on truth. No matter how much I may
exaggerate it, it must have a certain amount of
Truth. Vanderlip bases his Gags on Rumor.</p>

<p>Now Rumor travels Faster, but it don’t stay put
as long as Truth. I will, however, give him credit
for one thing. While here lately everybody is telling
what he has heard, and all about this and that
rumor, why, he thought of by far the best ones I
have heard up to now.</p>

<p>That’s no small accomplishment I tell you, in this
year of Rumors, to be able to say at the end of it:
“Well, I told the best ones.”</p>

<p>His were so good that before his audience got<span class="pagenum" id="Page_266">[Pg 266]</span>
through applauding at Sing Sing (or rather Ossining)
why, they had him on the stand at Washington.
That’s the first time a Theatrical troup
ever jumped from Ossining to Washington.</p>

<p>They even put him on ahead of Fall, Sinclair, and
all the Headliners.</p>

<p>Well, sir, I have a real Message for my
readers. It looked like it would be just
the ordinary Article with no flavor or
Backbone or Truth, and with no real underlying
news or wisdom, that is, nothing that the people
would be glad to know and read. As I say, that
is the kind of Article I thought it would be. But
as I picked up the morning Papers, why, I read
who was in our midst out here in Sunny California.
Well, sir, it struck me like a thunderbolt
here was news which my public had been longing
for for years and here I had found it out!</p>

<p>Well, I says to myself, this is too good to keep,
for here people had been wondering all this time
for just what I knew now. I kinder hated to leave
the East on account of thinking I would be out of
touch with some of our National Characters but
I find that sooner or later they all arrive out here
and start in fighting off Real Estate men the same
as shooing away Mosquitoes on Long Island.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_270">[Pg 270]</span></p>

<p>Well, who should blow in but two of our old long-lost
friends, and I know that even ’Frisco (who is
jealous of any one being here) will be glad to hear
they are here well and hearty, and rehearsed their
old Act here yesterday and people enjoyed them
just as much as they did in the old days.</p>

<p>Both of these Boys were on the big time and
were well known all around the Circuit, and any
time they took the Platform standing by the side
of a Pitcher of ice water and a glass, why, it just
meant 6 columns starting on the front page and
ending among the want ads. I bet you hadn’t heard
of them in years and will thank me for resurrecting
this information for you.</p>

<p>I can’t keep it any longer. I did want to keep
it till the finish of this to tell you but I must tell
you now who they are—William J. Bryan and
Billy Sunday!</p>

<p>Neither did I, but <i>they are</i>, and looking fine.</p>

<p>You know, if you have lost any one, look out
here, because sooner or later they will come here
to visit relatives, for anybody that has relatives
comes here so he can write back to other relatives.</p>

<p>They are both just resting here (so is everybody
else). Mr. Bryan is waiting till he finds out<span class="pagenum" id="Page_271">[Pg 271]</span>
where the next Democratic Convention will be held,
and then be there ready to knock any aspiring Presidential
Candidate on the head the minute it shows
above the mob.</p>

<p>The only way they will ever fool W. J. is some
presidential year decide not to run any one. Then
it will be a good joke on him; he will have no one
to object to.</p>

<p>Of course, now we don’t hear much of Democratic
Candidates, as both sides are busy watching to see
what Cal. will do. When he first become President
there seemed to be quite a Sentiment to nominate
him again for Vice President.</p>

<p>Everybody was wondering how he would come
out of the Coal strike situation, and figured his political
life or death depended on how he decided,
so he just fools everybody by appointing some other
man to settle it. Now, no other President had ever
been smart enough to think of a thing like that;
they tried to do it themselves, so I think he will go
a long ways. He figured, why should I get in
wrong when I can get some man to do it for me,
so he just looked around until he found some other
fellow who had a political future.</p>

<p>He said, “Gifford, you go get in wrong with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_272">[Pg 272]</span>
which ever side you decide against.” Now, the
minute a Crisis comes up, all he has to do is to
remember some Republican name and appoint him
to settle it for him.</p>

<p>Now the only Crisis that Mr. Coolidge can possibly
get into, himself, is running out of Republicans
to appoint. In that case he would have to appoint
a Democrat which would bring on a worse Crisis
than the one he appointed him to settle.</p>

<p>But I am not here to talk about Cal. and what
he is doing. I am here to tell you of these two
long lost Prodigals that I discovered in the wilds
of this Village. They were preaching in a Pulpit.
I guess that’s why no one had seen them for so
long. Both these Boys, in the good old days used
to talk in a Tent. Now you can always attract a
crowd in a Tent, for they figure that it might be
a Circus. Come to think of it, their Acts were
similar; either one of them could take a Dictionary
and sink an enemy with words at 40 paces.</p>

<p>Bryan’s speeches have been the only thing to look
forward to at a Democratic Convention for years.
He has sent more Presidential Candidates home
without a Reception Committee meeting them than
any Monologist living. He can take a batch of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_273">[Pg 273]</span>
words and scramble them together and leaven them
properly with a hunk of Oratory and knock the
White House door knob right out of a Candidate’s
hand.</p>

<p>Bryan has made more Political speeches than
Germany has Marks. He kissed, when they were
Babies, every man and woman in the United States
who is now up to the age of 45. He has juggled
the destinies of America more than any two Presidents
because he has the choosing or rejecting of
them.</p>

<p>His career has varied from Non-intoxication to
Evolution; his hobbies have jumped from Grape
juice to Monkeys. He tries to prove that we did
not descend from the Monkey, but he unfortunately
picked a time when the actions of our people prove
that we did. He, undoubtedly, is one of our greatest
minds and in most of his Theories he has been
just too far ahead of the mob.</p>

<p>He preached Prohibition at a time when it meant
Political Suicide for himself. I bet the next Democratic
Candidate for President, no matter how strong
he may think he is, would rather have the support
of W. J. Bryan than any doubtful State in the
Union.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_274">[Pg 274]</span></p>

<p>Now that brings to us his accomplice, Willie
Sunday, who I discovered staggering from one of
our Local Pulpits last Sunday. To some of you who
can’t or don’t wish to remember, Billy passed out
just as Andy Volstead made his entrance. Now Barnum
invented the Tent, but Billy Sunday filled it.
He can get more people into a tent than an Iowa
Picnic at Long Beach, California.</p>

<p>He is the only man in Ecclesiastical or Biblical
history that ever had to train physically, for a sermon.
He brought more converts to Prohibition before
the 18th Amendment come in, than the 18th
Amendment has converted to Prohibition since it
went in.</p>

<p>He is the first preacher to specialize on Liquor.
While Bryan’s oratorical wrath in the later years
has been hurled at Darwin, Billy Sunday picks his
opponent with a carelessness that is almost reckless.</p>

<p>I suppose that he has had more mortal worldly
combats with the Devil himself than any man living.
He has challenged the Devil publicly more times
than Wills, the Negro, has Jack Dempsey. People
have been going for years to hear Billy, just figuring
that if they didn’t go that night it might be the very
night the Devil would hear what Billy was calling<span class="pagenum" id="Page_275">[Pg 275]</span>
him and come up, and they might miss what would
happen.</p>

<p>I don’t know this Devil myself but if he heard
Billy say these things and didn’t come up and call
him for it, I think less of him than Billy does.
Of course, the Devil may be just good natured,
and figure, well, he can’t hurt <i>ME</i>, and if he can
get anything out of it why let him go ahead.</p>

<p>Now, of course, you can get a fellow wrong.
Billy used to lay all the drinking on to this Devil,
and claimed that if we had Prohibition we could
lick this Devil. Now we got Prohibition, I don’t
think he can legitimately lay the present drinking
onto the Devil.</p>

<p>Course, from this I don’t want you to think I
am taking sides in this thing. I don’t know either
one personally. But, as I say, there is a chance that
they both may have each other wrong. As I say,
Billy must have something on the Devil or he
wouldn’t dare to call him what he does, especially
if the Devil can hear him, and I tell you the Devil
must be pretty low if he don’t answer him, that is,
if he hears him.</p>

<p>I have always figured that the reason that the
Devil didn’t arise and respond was Billy’s slang<span class="pagenum" id="Page_276">[Pg 276]</span>
was too much for him. But Billy sure did do a
lot of good in the old days, and no matter if you
didn’t like his style of sermon, you sure didn’t get
a chance to do any sleeping.</p>

<p>So I hope we can keep them both out here with
us, and help to get some of our population’s mind
on the Church on Sunday instead of being continually
looking for lots.</p>

<p>As I pen you these few lines, the Democratic
National Convention is still going on; going
on to where, nobody knows. But it has to
end some time for even a Delegate can only stand
just so much Oratory.</p>

<p>All the first week was taken up with seconding
the nomination of McAdoo and Al Smith.</p>

<p>It looked like they were going to run out of people
to do it, and they would have to second each other.</p>

<p>I wish you could have been there and heard what
great men we have in this Country. We started
out with 16 men for President. Here is what each
one of them was.—“The only Man who can carry
the Democratic Party to a Glorious Victory in November.
Whose every act has been an inspiration to
his fellow men. Not only loved in his Home State
but in every State.” Well, there was six continuous
days of that.</p>

<p>Then the Ku Klux Klan argument come along,
and really it was welcome even in New York. Just<span class="pagenum" id="Page_280">[Pg 280]</span>
to get people’s mind off that continuous, “The Man
I am about to name to you.”</p>

<p>One day and up to two thirty in the Night they
fought and argued the Klan. It was the most exciting
and Dramatic night I ever saw in my life.</p>

<p>After 11 hundred Delegates voted and recounted
and voted the thing stood only about one vote apart,
in fact a fraction of a vote, due to North Carolina,
instead of having an election and naming 24
Delegates, just letting the whole State come as Delegates
and giving each one the usual Volstead Ratio,
Half of one percent of a Vote.</p>

<p>Alaska voted one Klu Klux away up there. Can
you imagine a man in all that Snow and Cold with
nothing on but a thin white Sheet and Pillow Slip?</p>

<p>My old Friend W. J. Bryan made one of his
characteristic speeches. He said that if they split
the Democratic Party with this Klan issue that another
great Party would arise to take its place.
Some guy up in the Gallery started Booing him.
He just stopped and waited a minute until the
heckler quit, then he said: “But no great leader
of any Party has ever come from the Gallery.”
After that they laid off him.</p>

<p>Ex-Secretary of War Baker made a Speech on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_281">[Pg 281]</span>
the League of Nations and spoke of the 4 Horsemen
of the Apocalypse, meaning I suppose, Borah,
La Follette, Johnson and Brookhart.</p>

<p>I arrived late one morning, well only about 15
minutes late, and they had nominated five men for
president already. I asked a Man in the Press
stand who they were and he said, “You wasn’t here
and you know them as well as I do.”</p>

<p>I had a friend who wanted to be nominated but
all the nominating speakers were so given out that
he had to let it go until next Election, that is in
case they ever have another one.</p>

<p>If the one who is nominated can only swing the
votes of the ones who were defeated he will give
Mr. Coolidge a tight race.</p>

<p>Talk about Presidential Timber. Why, man, they
had whole Lumber yards of it here.</p>

<p>There was so many being Nominated that some
of the Men making the nominating Speeches had
never even met the man they were nominating.</p>

<p>I know they had not from the way they talked
about them.</p>

<p>Every time the speaker nominated somebody, why
the Band would strike up what they thought was
an appropriate tune. The bird nominated Gov.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_282">[Pg 282]</span>
Brown of New Hampshire kept talking and referring
to “The Old Granite State. That Glorious
old Granite State.” When he finished the Band
played “Rock of Ages”. There was granite for
you.</p>

<p>They nominated from a list of all Democrats.
They drew them out the night before the convention.</p>

<p>Some Man named Stuart from Illinois got up to
nominate somebody, and we knew we would hear
something about Lincoln being born in Illinois, and
sure enough we did. He kept quoting Lincoln’s
famous remark about, “God must have loved the
common people because he made so many of them.”
Well this Bird kept talking about his man being
for the common people, and he flopped terribly.
You are not going to get people’s votes nowadays
by calling them common. Lincoln might have said
it but I bet you it was not until after he was elected.</p>

<p>The fellow that nominated Charley Bryan from
Nebraska was the only truthful one. He said, “I
am going to nominate a Politician,” You know nobody
at these things dare mention Politician. Matchless
leader or successor to Jefferson are about as
low as they ever mention. This fellow told how<span class="pagenum" id="Page_283">[Pg 283]</span>
Bryan had lowered the price of Gasoline in Nebraska.
And a crowd of people was seen to leave
the hall. I think it was John D. Rockefeller and
his Bible Class.</p>

<p>In the Charley Bryan demonstration staged by
Nebraska, Florida joined in out of brotherly love.</p>

<p>When Bryan was presented the Band played
“Way down Yonder in the Corn Field.”</p>

<p>When Jimmy Cox was Nominated the band
played, “Should Old Acquaintance Be Forgot.”
Jimmy Cox is a mighty fine man, But I don’t know
of any quicker way in the World to be forgotten
in this Country than to be defeated for President.
A Man can leave the Country and people will always
remember that he went some place. But
if he is defeated for President they can’t remember
that he ever did anything.</p>

<p>Smith’s Demonstration lasted one hour and a
Half. McAdoo’s almost as long. But most of
them just managed to last through a verse and
one chorus by the Band.</p>

<p>Matthews of New Jersey nominated Gov. Silzer
also of New Jersey. He made a plea for him on
the ground that he came from the same state that
President Wilson did. That don’t mean anything.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_284">[Pg 284]</span>
Look I come from the same state that Harry Sinclair
did. Yet I couldn’t find an Oil Well without
a search warrant.</p>

<p>His principal plea for Silzer was on the Highways
of New Jersey. So if people west of the Mississippi
and down south want a President who will
keep the Roads of New Jersey up in good shape
you can’t do better than have him.</p>

<p>A guy from Utah talked so long and loud that
all of us couldn’t see how it could be anybody in
the world he was nominating but Brigham Young
that Matchless Father. But at the finish he crossed
by saying he was seconding McAdoo’s nomination.</p>

<p>You could never tell until one got through who
he was going to name. They would pull the name
last. That would be the only surprise they had.</p>

<p>Quinn of Minnesota throwed the biggest scare
into the Convention. He praised his man so high
that everybody in the hall knew it couldn’t be anybody
but La Follette but he fooled us all by seconding
Smith. In his talk he never spoke of anything
east of St. Paul and in Smith’s travels he has
never been west of Syracuse. So you see for yourself
how hard it was to follow who they were going
to name.</p>

</div>


<p>Well, I guess you heard about my Presidential
Boom. You know every calamity
in the World befell the Democrats while
they were here in session the last couple of years.
First they started in nominating. The entire first
week was taken up with that. They nominated so
many Democrats that if it had kept up another
day they would have had to go over into the Republican
Column. They talked their Delegates and
audience to death the first week. No wonder they
couldn’t agree there was no two Delegates that could
remember the same Candidate.</p>

<p>Well, it ran along week after week and the longer
it ran the more confused the Delegates got. They
began to get this Convention mixed up with the
San Francisco one, because it had been so long since
they left home, why, both Conventions seemed about
the same distance off. One Delegation got to voting
for Cox thinking it was ’Frisco. The Chairman
had no more than got that straightened out
and explained to them that this was an entirely different<span class="pagenum" id="Page_288">[Pg 288]</span>
year when what does my Native State of
Oklahoma do! They woke up the Chairman of
their Delegation right quick one day to answer Roll
Call and he blurts out, “Oklahoma votes 20 for
Robert L. Owen.” Well, the chairman had to
explain to them that this was not 1920, and that
Mr. Owen was not a Candidate, he was only a
Delegate. The Missouri Delegation, when they
could not get any two to agree, voted for two days
for Champ Clark, until Telegrams commenced to
pour in telling them of his demise.</p>

<p>Nebraska voted for Bryan, and got sore when
the rest of the Convention thought it was W. J.
They said it was a Son or a Brother or something
of his. Mississippi and Louisiana started voting for
my old friend Pat Harrison and Pat’s Bottle run
out, and they found an old Hoffman House Hotel
Register, and from that on they just voted for the
names on it.</p>

<p>Alabama was the only State that you could absolutely
depend on. It seems that years ago Alabama
sent a Delegation to some Convention instructed
for a Candidate and that when they got
there they sold out and voted for another. So they
have passed a Law that any time they send a troup<span class="pagenum" id="Page_289">[Pg 289]</span>
away again that they were going to vote for the
man they told them to until the Candidate’s body
had been duly pronounced dead by the Home
Coroner. Well, that knocked any chance of profit
out of this trip as far as Alabama was concerned.</p>

<p>La Follette, out in Cleveland, wrote a Platform,
held a Convention, nominated himself, and went
home. All this happened during the time they were
polling the Illinois Delegation here at this Convention.</p>

<p>Women Delegates started in with Bobbed Hair
and wound up by being able to sit on it. One
Woman sent back home for her washing machine.
The Arkansas Delegation started in whittling up
the Board floor and whittled their way from the
Back of the Hall up to the Speaker’s Platform.
There was so many shavings under their Chairs
that if a fire had ever broken out in the building,
between these shavings and the long Whiskers, why,
there would never in the World have been a way
to stop it. There was one old long bearded Man
from Utah, that when the voting on the Klan got
close shook 4 Delegates with half a vote each out
from under his Whiskers and decided the issue right
there.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_290">[Pg 290]</span></p>

<p>All the members of the National Committees had
Gold Badges to start in with. The thing had only
gone along a few weeks when they commenced to
turn green and finally you couldn’t tell whether it
was a Badge or a Shamrock.</p>

<p>It’s too bad because all the Delegates here will
lose their votes when they go home this Fall. The
law plainly states that you must have been a resident
of the State for the last 6 months. If they
were not thoughtful to register when they come to
New York, they will lose their votes entirely.</p>

<p>Lots of the Delegates also had Wives who were
Delegates, and this has been the longest time they
ever spent together in their lives. I bet you will
never see another Man go on a Delegation to a
Democratic Convention when his Wife is on one.
South Carolina has no Divorces, so of course this
Convention gave all their members a chance to get
out of the State, claim a residence of 6 months, and
be divorced before they get home.</p>

<p>Now, mind you, as I pen these lines this thing
is still going on. It’s Monday morning of the third
week. I don’t know now who they will nominate.
In fact people have lost interest. If they ever do
nominate somebody some of the Papers may carry it
and you may know it by the time you read this, but
I doubt if he will even be nominated by then. If
he is, it will be too late to get his name on the Ballot
by November, as the racing Forms have already
gone to press for the November Classic. I am
certainly glad that La Follette entered. That will
give Coolidge somebody to run against, anyway.</p>

BIRTHRATE.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_292">[Pg 292]</span></p>
<p>If they don’t hurry up they will be the only Party
in the World that ever nominated a Candidate and
got him defeated on the same day.</p>

<p>In number of Population the Convention is holding
its own. The deaths from old age among the
Delegates is about offset by the Birthrate. Personally
I think that the Candidates who will finally
be nominated will be born in this Convention.</p>

<p>I have been writing a daily account for the
Papers for this seven years’ Hitch. I took it for
so much for the job. If I had signed by the word
I would be able now to walk by and hiss Rockefeller.</p>

<p>In 1860, the Almanac says, a Democratic Convention
was moved from Charleston to Baltimore.
There is nobody here in this Convention to verify
it, so I doubt if it ever happened. But, anyway,
they talked for two Days about moving this one,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_293">[Pg 293]</span>
on account of it being held here in New York
where one of the Candidates lives. Well, they
got to figuring and there was no Town they could
take it to that didn’t have a Candidate who lived
there.</p>

<p>Of course their thoughts naturally turned to
Claremore, Oklahoma, the best Town between Foyil
and Catoosa in Oklahoma. Then when Arizona
showed such splendid judgment in putting me in
nomination, why of course we couldn’t go there on
account of the Galleries there being biased in favor
of my nomination. Then they figured they might
just as well stay here. Everybody had got used
to the place, and if they moved them they would
just have to get used to sleeping in strange chairs
again, and maybe by a different seating arrangement
they might be sleeping next to some one they
didn’t even know. It meant really a lot of trouble,
anyway, opening up new credit accounts and getting
used to a different Climate.</p>

<p>I want the Democrats to just pass this election
by without getting beat and then center all their
forces on 1928. Cal. will be ineligible then, unless
they may pass a Constitutional amendment to elect
a President for life—and he is so lucky they are<span class="pagenum" id="Page_294">[Pg 294]</span>
just liable to do it. But if he is out, the Republicans
will have to get a new man too. Then it will
be an even break.</p>

<p>But go ahead with this Convention and pick him
now. In fact I would pick out three or four to
run in rotation in 1928, ’32, ’36, and so on, because
you will never get Democratic Delegates to
give up the best part of their lives by attending another
one of these things. If they are wise today
down there they will pick Jackie Coogan, for President
and Baby Peggy for Vice President.</p>

<p>Will Rogers Jr. attended the convention
to take up the duties of reporter to
replace his venerable old father.</p>
</div>

<p class="center">By WILL ROGERS JR.</p>


<p>Papa called us all in last night and made his last
will and testament, he called it. He said he had
carried his work on just as long as he could and
he realized that he was unable, on account of his old
age, to go further with it. He put in the will that
I being the oldest was to take up his life’s work,
that of reporting the Democratic National Convention.</p>

<p>He herded us all and told us of how he had given
all the best years of his life to this and out of respect
to his name and memory that we children should
carry on. And that our children were to do likewise
and that we should raise them to always know that
their mission through life would be to keep reporting<span class="pagenum" id="Page_298">[Pg 298]</span>
the progress of the Democratic National Convention
at New York. And it was in the will that if we
didn’t we would forfeit any claim to any royalties
that might still be coming due from books that
he had written on the early life of the convention.</p>

<p>Mama wants to send him to the Old Men and
Old Women’s Home for Survivors of this Convention,
but he won’t go. Poor Mama is worried about
him. He won’t talk rational. He just keeps saying,
“Alabama” and “for what purpose does the gentleman
arise,” and “if we can’t elect our candidate we
will see that you don’t get yours” and “unfit” and
“release.” We don’t know what it all means.</p>

<p>Now, Mr. Editor, I am only a little boy and I
am not much of a reporter, but Papa told us we
didn’t have to be very good; that all we must practice
was endurance. But you will, Mr. Editor, please
take my story, won’t you for Mama’s sake, for she
knew how poor Papa hated to give up and how proud
he will be if I can only keep his life’s work going?</p>

<p>Mama got our Dad’s old press badge and
patched it up so it would stick together and I went
down today. The hall was full of all those feeble
people and it looked kinder like a church; everybody
was sleeping. All but one man, who was standing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_299">[Pg 299]</span>
and reading aloud out of a geography the names of
States that are situated in the Western Hemisphere
and that don’t belong to Canada.</p>

<p>Papa had given me an old worn and torn paper
with a list on it that he had used to mark off the
numbers on when this convention started. He told
me to always keep it for comparisons. Also that a
museum had tried to buy it from him. I go to
school and our teacher had told us what a wonderful
country this is we live in, and how it had stuck so
well together and, sure enough, when this man kept
reading these names and figures, why, on Dad’s
old paper were a lot of the same ones.</p>

<p>I kept waiting for him to call out the name “Wisconsin”
that Dad had, but this fellow didn’t have
it on his, and according to Dad’s old paper we at
that time had California and anybody knows that
Japan has owned California for years. On Dad’s
old paper they still had the Philippine Islands, which
is now Japan’s Naval Base. But as for the candidates,
the names were just the same. None of them
had dropped out. Their sons were carrying on
their father’s life work too, trying to hold what
votes they had. Saulsbury Jr. had six. Underwood
Jr. had a few more than what was on Dad’s paper,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_300">[Pg 300]</span>
as the State of Alabama had more population and
had naturally increased its number of delegates.</p>

<p>An old man sat by me and I got to talking to
him and he seemed to want to be friendly and talk of
his early life. He said his name was Coogan.
“Jackie Coogan,” I think he said, and that he used
to be in some old fashioned things called moving
pictures, and that he could remember as a child when
this started that men used to be wakened up and
have to call out the numbers when their States were
called. But now they have little phonographs and
every time a State is called, why the phonograph
says “Two and nine eighths for Smith Jr. and one
and sixty-five fifths for McAdoo Jr.” and so on.</p>

<p>A man has a hammer and he couldn’t keep them
awake with it any longer so they adjourned, and the
attendants wheeled them all out. It was only about
three o’clock in the afternoon and they were to be
back again at nine. I went home to tell Pop what
had happened and to write my story. He said, “It’s
looking better, son; they are adjourning earlier and
starting later. Maybe the miracle will happen,”
and his old eyes began to gleam as he seemed to
vision the end of his glorious dream.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_301">[Pg 301]</span></p>

<p>Then I told him very enthusiastically, “Oh, yes,
Pop, it looks great because a man with a family
name of Brennan got up, and one named Cramer,
and said they would adjourn and hold a conference
of leaders and would have something to report by
tonight.”</p>

<p>Well, I wish you could have seen my poor old
Dad. He went into spasms. He pulled his hair.
He raved. None of us could do anything with him.
He had been all right before I had mentioned this
leader and conference business. He then said:</p>

<p>“Son, those same men’s fathers started holding
those conferences forty years ago. Going to report
something to the convention tonight? That is exactly
what is the matter with this convention now,
it’s those conferences. If they had let the delegates
confer instead of the leaders, why, your poor old
father could have spent a life of usefulness instead
of one listening to a man read off numbers, which
we all knew better than he did.</p>

<p>“Son, if it’s the Taggarts and Rockwells and
Macks and Cramers and all of them that are conferring,
you will die, like your poor old father, right
at your post, listening for something to happen.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_302">[Pg 302]</span></p>

<p>So please, Mr. Editor, take this story, and tomorrow,
when I come home to dear old Dad, I
will make him feel good. I won’t tell him they are
going to hold another conference.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="ROPING_A_CRITIC_2">ROPING A CRITIC</h2>
</div>


<p>Prologue—These critics have been interviewing
Actors (and us other people that appear
on the stage) for years. And none of
the interviews have ever been right, cause they never
told the truth. Course they couldn’t tell the truth
about a lot of us, if they had he would have put us
out of business. But they tried to be so kind to us
and tell all the noble deeds that at the finish we had
lost more friends than we had gained by the interview.</p>

<p>Now there is nothing interesting in an Actor but
his act and you can get it at the box office price.
This season you won’t even have to form in line. If
you can get a party of three to go with you you can
get a rate.</p>

<p>But I figured there was something interesting
about a Critic. Why, there are scientists that spend
a life time studying a Toad.</p>

<p>Now, I might not find out as much as these Toad
experts but I am going to look one of these Critics
over at short range for about an hour—as Actors<span class="pagenum" id="Page_306">[Pg 306]</span>
have got plenty of time—we are not bowing much
nowadays.</p>

<p>So I picked out the Male of the Species as they
are not as venomous as the females. I picked out
Ashton Stevens, principally on account of him being
frail of statue and because I had seen his name one
time on an Ash Can for endorsing a Wintergarden
Show.</p>

<p>Act I. DRESSING ROOM COLONIAL
THEATER.—Enter Stevens made up as Critic.
Gray suit, leather buttons, Black Felt Hat on upside
down (same one Dick Little used to wear), middle
finger of each hand calloused from knocking Actors.
Smoking Pipe which is against all Theater rules, but
on account of being critic managers can’t say anything.
The smoking really wasn’t as bad as the
Tobacco.</p>

<p>I started in to interview him and he started in like
an Actor by lying. So I stopped him right there and
said: “Say, this is not a theatrical interview. I am
representing the Public and I want the real dope on
Critics.”</p>

<p>Q—Where were you born? Even a Critic has to
be born.</p>

<p>A—I was born in San Francisco in 18—.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_307">[Pg 307]</span></p>

<p>Q—Never mind when you were born—the reading
public can tell by your jokes how old you are.
Why were you born?</p>

<p>A—No answer.</p>

<p>Q—Well, if you can’t think of a reason neither
can I, so we will let that question go. Did Frisco
ever find out that you were born there?</p>

<p>A—Yes.</p>

<p>Q—Is that why you left there?</p>

<p>A—No answer.</p>

<p>Q—When did you first show symptoms of becoming
a Critic?</p>

<p>A—When I had lost my job at everything else.</p>

<p>Q—Didn’t you tell your folks and didn’t they
have anything done for you to cure this?</p>

<p>A—I was afraid to tell them.</p>

<p>Q—Who gave you your first job Criticing?</p>

<p>A—William Randolph Hearst.</p>

<p>Q—Why did he give it to you?</p>

<p>A—He heard me play the Banjo.</p>

<p>Q—He heard you play the Banjo and gave you a
job as a Critic. I suppose if he saw me throw a
rope he would make me a Society Editor?</p>

<p>A—Oh, but it is not for my Banjoing that he
keeps me now, its for my writings.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_308">[Pg 308]</span></p>

<p>Q—Oh, he has forgot that you taught him to play
the Banjo—that’s why you still work for him?</p>

<p>A—No, its my writings. You see he took me
from Frisco to New York and put me on the New
York Journal.</p>

<p>Q—Now you say he took you there as Critic.
Don’t you really think he might have been getting
a little rusty on the Banjo and needed it tuned?</p>

<p>A—No, I stayed there 4 years.</p>

<p>Q—What happened at the end of 4 years, did you
all run out of Tunes, or did you break the Banjo or
what?</p>

<p>A—No; then he promoted me to Chicago.</p>

<p>Q—You felt that you had taught him all you
knew. Did you bring the Banjo out here with you?</p>

<p>A—Oh, yes I have it; I will bring it over now and
Show you how I play.</p>

<p>Q—Never mind bringing it over now or any other
time. We will drop the Banjo until some time you
feel you want a change of jobs. You can take it
over to Medill McCormicks and teach him. He
could at least amuse the other Senators with it and
perhaps make you Editor of the Tribune. Now to
get back to Criticing. What makes a Dramatic
Critic?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_309">[Pg 309]</span></p>

<p>A—Two Free Seats a Night on the Isle.</p>

<p>Q—Is it true that it is the only business in the
World with absolutely no qualifications?</p>

<p>A—Yes; next to being a comedian with a Ziegfeld
Show its the only thing that requires no training.</p>

<p>Q—Is it true that Dyspepsia is necessary to being
a Critic?</p>

<p>A—Yes; its more prevalent now since the Movies
come in.</p>

<p>Q—Don’t you think that Prohibition has lowered
the Standard of Dramatic Criticism?</p>

<p>A—Yes; among those that didn’t look ahead and
supply, I think that to be true.</p>

<p>Q—They still train on Scotch, don’t they?</p>

<p>A—Well, they are not as well trained as they
used to be.</p>

<p>Q—Don’t you find a great many people that think
they are Critics?</p>

<p>A—Yes, but I find very few that get paid for it.</p>

<p>Q—Do you believe in constructive Criticism?</p>

<p>A—No; I believe in entertaining Criticism.</p>

<p>Q—Do you get many letters kicking on your
opinion?</p>

<p>A—Oh, yes; quite a few.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_310">[Pg 310]</span></p>

<p>Q—In that way you can tell just how many read
it, can’t you? I read where three out of four of
every newspaper started failed. What percentage of
dramatic Criticisms do you think is responsible for
this failure?</p>

<p>A—I don’t know; I was never on a failing paper.</p>

<p>Q—That’s pretty good; that’s a Nifty. Now you
Critics having never tried it, you don’t realize just
how hard it is to be an Actor?</p>

<p>A—Yes, the more plays we see the more we
realize it.</p>

<p>Q—Now, you say you have worked for Mr.
Hearst twenty-five years for teaching him the Banjo.
What instrument did Brisbane teach him and do
you think I could interest him in a Base Drum? I
hammer a mean Blues on one of those things.</p>

<p>A—You might snare him with that. It takes
two heads to make a drum.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Now, Dear Readers—both of you—if this little
interview has made you feel more kindly toward the
Dramatic Critics, and has brought their overworked
profession to the high standards to which I have
tried to honestly picture them, my work will not
have been in vain.</p>

<p>Now for the last few months I have been
writing and I have become ambitious and
want to do “Bigger and Better things.”
I realize that my writings up to now have only
appealed to the Morons. (That’s not Mormon
misspelled. It’s <i>Morons</i>, just as it’s spelled.) So
I have been a close Student and admirer of
some of our great editorial writers and I have
tried to study their style and, beginning with
this article, I am changing my entire method of
Literature and I hereby bid Adieu to my Half-Wit
Audience. (As a writer’s Writings never appeal to
a higher grade of intelligence than the Writer himself.)
So, from now on, I am going to give these
learned and heavy thinkers a run for their Laurels.
I am out to make the front Page. My Column
will be called The World Tomorrow, not only commenting
on the news of Today but predicting what
the morrow will bring forth.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_314">[Pg 314]</span></p>
<p>A Race Horse, In Memorandum, beats the great
Zev, the International Favorite and My Own thrown
in for good measure. That news will perhaps interest
40 million Human Beings, and 2,000 Bookmakers,
while the news of the unearthing of a Prehistoric
Skull at Santa Barbara, California, linking
us up with the Neanderthal Age will only be appreciated
by a small Majority of us thinking People.
Some anthropologists, however, consider the extinct
Neanderthal Man as a separate Species (Homo
Neanderthalenis) intermediate between the Java
Man (or Pithecanthropus). According to Linneaus,
Humanity comprises four races: the Whites, having
a light colored skin, belonging to the Caucasian
race; the Blacks, the completest possible negation
of White; the Republicans, form of genus Homo
ape in his earliest Prehistoric State; and, last of
the four Races the Democrat. The Democrat
doubtless originated in the eastern Hemisphere. The
main structural characters distinguishing him are his
gait, the modification of the feet for walking instead
of prehension, and the great Toe being non-opposable,
and, most of all, the enormous development
of the brain, and smooth rounded Skull.</p>

<p>But what cares the man of today for the Neanderthal<span class="pagenum" id="Page_315">[Pg 315]</span>
Age! He is of the Speculative Age. If he
can get 10 Dollars down on the Nose of a winner
at about 15 to one, he don’t care if we descend from
Goat or Ape.</p>

<p>As Demosthenes, the Great William Jennings
Bryan of his time, so aptly put it when he casually
met Confucius, the originator of Mah-Jong on
Epsom Downs: “Good Afternoon, countryman, art
thee risking a few Shekels on thy favorite Crow
Bait in this Race?” And Confucius pulled the following
Nifty which has been handed down through
the Ages, and made him the Philosopher or Shanghai:</p>

<p>“No, Demosthenes, Betting is a form of unintelligence.
So long as we have betting, we will know
we have the ignorant with us.”</p>

<p>That little remark of Confucius was well said,
and the fact that we had 40 million interested in the
Race, and only a handful interested in the Neanderthal
Man, proves we have a long way to go yet until
Civilization is thoroughly reached.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>The Crown Prince of Germany is to be allowed to
return, proving that War don’t pay. You only have
to go back into History a short way to the Trojan<span class="pagenum" id="Page_316">[Pg 316]</span>
Wars. What happened to Priam the King of Troy
when Prince Paris his Heir and Son was born?
Eros, Goddess of Discord, threw out a Golden
Apple to the most beautiful, and Juno, Minerva
and Venus all claimed it. Paris was to decide. He
gave the Apple to Venus. Helen of Troy, the most
beautiful Woman in Sparta, got jealous of Paris
and that culminated in the War of Troy. Troy
was besieged for 9 years. This Trojan War alone
should prove to the greedy Interests that War don’t
pay. And Sons born of Kings don’t pay. A law
should be passed that all offspring of Royal Birth
should be of the feminine Gender.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>An American army airman flies at the rate of
258 miles an hour. What does this astounding feat
mean to the World? What did Napoleon say at
Austerlitz in 1805, just after the battle of Ulm,
and after the Old Corsican had rushed his troops
from Cologne? He said, “An army travels on its
Stomach.”</p>

<p>Look at the progress that has been made in the
mode of Transportation from the Napoleon days
to this! I don’t know exactly how far a man could
travel in a day on his Stomach. If he had a good<span class="pagenum" id="Page_317">[Pg 317]</span>
Stomach and was an Apt Traveler he might make
pretty good headway. There was no way in reckoning
speed in those days as there was no way of
fixing a speedometer on a Soldier’s Stomach, but
if you take a Soldier going away from the Enemy,
and if his Stomach held out, he certainly ought to
have had the abdominal record of his time.</p>

<p>But has Congress heeded what the Airship is
doing? No, they go ahead building Battleships
which will be as useless as a shipping board. Transportation
advances but our Lawmakers are still
traveling on their Stomach.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Lloyd George goes home to England after inviting
us to join in the Salvation of Europe. You
have only to turn to Hugo’s Oration on Voltaire to
find out if we should meddle in the selfish affairs of
European Turmoil. Hugo said: “Before going further,
let us come to an understanding, Gentlemen,
upon the word Abyss. There are good abysses: such
are the abysses in which evil is engulfed. Rabelais
warned royalty in Gargantua. Moliere warned the
people at Tartuffe.” That proves right there to
any thinking person that we should not meddle in
the affairs of these envious Nations. The more<span class="pagenum" id="Page_318">[Pg 318]</span>
Trouble you get them out of, the more they get
into. No, the time has come when this Country
has got to bank up our own fires for a cold morning.
Just remember Cicero’s words speaking at Glasgow
in regard to America’s participation in the World’s
War: “La premiere femme du monde la tete montee
en se couchant.” Those who want to adjust Europe’s
Carburetor should remember Horace Greeley’s
immortal Gag: “Go west, young man, <i>Not</i>
east.”</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>A Lady in Chicago is arrested for killing a casual
acquaintance. That’s news. If she had killed her
Husband or Lover that would be commonplace.
But friends are seldom killed. What does the 8th
chapter, second verse, of the first Book of Matthew
teach us? That verse should be enough to teach us
that friendship should be trusted. We will never
have true civilization until we have learned to recognize
the rights of others.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Judge Gary, the head of the great Steel Corporation,
eats only the white of a soft boiled egg
for breakfast. Which should be a lesson to some
of you who think you have to eat the whole egg
to subsist. We should look and learn from our Men<span class="pagenum" id="Page_319">[Pg 319]</span>
who have Done Things. Read Einstein’s Theory on
what constitutes over-gorging. He says: “Light
rays, if obstructed, have an observed constant velocity
irrespective of the relative velocity between
the observer.” That should show even the ignorant
when they have enough.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>A little Girl in Brooklyn started to school and
forgot her books and had to go home for them.
There you have a bit of news that is valuable. We
are at that age when we are rushing headlong and
paying no attention to small details. It’s only the
big things of life that interest us. For instance,
the little Girl was only interested in getting to the
School, not in what she had when she got there.
If we only stopped to realize that it is really after
all the little things that count, why, we would be a
wiser and more contented race. People that can’t
remember should remember what Socrates said to
Plato on the subject of forgetfulness. He said:
“Where then I wonder shall we find Justice and
Injustice in it? With which have we contemplated?
Has it simultaneously made its entrance?”</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>A Professor of Columbia University won a prize
by writing a Book in 15 hours. That’s a good<span class="pagenum" id="Page_320">[Pg 320]</span>
thing. The quicker the Authors write them the
quicker they can get to some useful work. But if
Pascal were on earth today and heard of that feat
he would say: “That’s fine, Professor, but what did
you do with the other 10 Hours?”</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>It takes two and a half Tons of Marks to buy
a Stein of Beer in Berlin. Before the War you
could have bought two and a half Tons of Beer for
a Mark. What does Wall Street think of that?
It shows you that selfish Interests can’t rule the
People, when they make up their mind to rebel.</p>

<p>Well, they brought our Soldiers back
from Germany. Would have brought
them back sooner but we didn’t have
anybody in Washington who knew where they were.
We had to leave ’em over there so they could get
the Mail that was sent to them during the war.
Had to leave ’em over there anyway; two of them
hadn’t married yet.</p>

<p>Since I wrote you last, an awful lot has happened
at the Studio in Washington, D. C. You know out
where they make the Movies, the place we make
them is called the Studio. We are a great deal alike
in lots of respects. We make what we think will
be two kinds of Pictures, Comedy and Drama, or
sad ones. Now you take the Capitol at Washington,
that’s the biggest Studio in the World. We
call ours, Pictures, when they are turned out. They
call theirs Laws, or Bills. It’s all the same thing.
We often make what we think is Drama, but when<span class="pagenum" id="Page_324">[Pg 324]</span>
it is shown it is received by the audience as Comedy.
So the uncertainty is about equal both places.</p>

<p>The way to judge a good Comedy is by how long
it will last and have people talk about it. Now
Congress has turned out some that have lived for
years and people are still laughing about them, and
as for Sad productions, they have turned out some
that for sadness make “Over the Hills” look like
a roaring farce.</p>

<p>Girls win a little State Popularity Contest that
is conducted by some Newspaper; then they are
put into the Movies to entertain 110 million people
who they never saw or know anything about. Now
that’s the same way with the Capitol Comedy Company
of Washington. They win a State Popularity
Contest backed by a Newspaper and are sent to
Washington to turn out Laws for 110 million people
they never saw.</p>

<p>They have what they call Congress, or the Lower
House. That compares to what we call the Scenario
Department. That’s where somebody gets
the idea of what he thinks will make a good Comedy
Bill or Law, and they argue around and put it into
shape.</p>

<p>Then it is passed along, printed, or shot, or Photographed,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_325">[Pg 325]</span>
as we call it; then it reaches the Senate
or the Cutting and Titling Department. Now, in
our Movie Studios we have what we call Gag Men
whose sole business is to just furnish some little
Gag, or Amendment as they call it, which will get
a laugh or perhaps change the whole thing around.</p>

<p>Now the Senate has what is considered the best
and highest priced Gag Men that can be collected
anywhere. Why, they put in so many little gags or
amendments that the poor Author of the thing don’t
know his own story.</p>

<p>They consider if a man can sit there in the Studio
in Washington and just put in one funny amendment
in each Bill, or production, that will change
it from what it originally meant, why, he is considered
to have earned his pay. Take for Instance
the Prohibition Production that was introduced in
the Congress or Scenario Department as a Comedy.</p>

<p>Well, when it came up in the Senate, one of the
Gag or Title Men says, “I got an Idea; instead of
this just being a joke, and doing away with the
Saloons and Bar Rooms, why I will put in a Title
here that will do away with everything.” So they
sent around to all the Bars in Washington and got<span class="pagenum" id="Page_326">[Pg 326]</span>
a Quorum and released what was to be a harmless
little Comedy—made over into a Tragedy.</p>

<p>Then they put out a Production called the Non-Taxable
Bond, or “Let the Little Fellow Pay.”
Well it had a certain Vogue for a while with the
Rich. But it flopped terribly in the cheaper priced
Houses.</p>

<p>Another one they put out a lot of you will remember
was called the Income or Sur-Tax. It was
released under the Title of, “Inherit your money
and your Sur-Tax is Lighter.”</p>

<p>The main Character in this one was a working
man on salary, with no Capital investment to fall
back on, paying more on his income than the fellow
who has his original Capital and draws his money
just from interest. That Production has been
hissed in some of the best houses.</p>

<p>They started to put on a Big one that everybody
in America was looking forward to and wanted them
to produce called, “The Birth Of the Bonus,” or
“How Could You Forget so Soon!” But on account
of Finances they couldn’t produce that and
the “Non-Taxable Bond Production” both, so they
let the Bonus one go.</p>

<p>They have been working on two dandies. One<span class="pagenum" id="Page_327">[Pg 327]</span>
is called, “Refund, Refund, I am always refunding
You.” It’s principally for British Trade.</p>

<p>Then they got a Dandy Comedy; well, it’s really
a serial as they put it on every year. Everybody
in the whole Studio is interested in it and get a share
of it. It’s really their yearly Bonus in addition to
their Salary. It’s called, “Rivers and Harbors,” or,
“I’LL GET MINE.”</p>

<p>They got some of the funniest Scenes in there
where they take 56 million Dollars of the People’s
money and they promise to make a lot of Streams
wide enough to fish in. Now I saw a Pre-Release
of it and here are some of the Real Titles. In
Virginia, their Gag Senator has thought of a River
called the MATTIPONI. In North Carolina,
their Title writer, Overman, thought of a name,
the CONTENTNEA CREEK. But the funniest
Title in the whole Production is the CALOOSEHATCHIE,
in Florida. It’s located right in the
fairway of a Golf Course and Congress must move
it or in two years it will be filled up with Golf
Balls.</p>

<p>Then they have a scene applying for funds to
dredge TOMBIGBEE CREEK, and the BIG SUNFLOWER,
in Mississippi. Well, that’s money well<span class="pagenum" id="Page_328">[Pg 328]</span>
spent to do that, as they may find some of the
missing population.</p>

<p>And there’s the CLATSKANIE in Oregon. Now
what I am wondering is how our Navy is to make
the Jump from the Harbor of Tombigbee to the
Docks in Oregon on the Clatskanie. Of course,
that’s a different appropriation or production, and
will be arranged later.</p>

<p>Now I am off my Senators from Oklahoma,
especially Robert Owen, who is a part Cherokee Indian
like myself (and as proud of it as I am).
Now I got names right there on my farm where
I was born that are funny, too, and Owen don’t
do a thing to get me a Harbor on the VERDIGRIS
river at OOLAGAH in what used to be the District
of COOWEESCOOWEE (before we spoiled the
best Territory in the World to make a State).</p>

<p>Right across the river from me lives JIM TICK-EATER.
Now suppose a foreign fleet should come
up there. We can’t ask those Turtles and Water
Moccasins to move out without Government sanction.
If they haven’t got enough water in there
to fill the harbor (we are only 18 miles from
NOWATER, Oklahoma), why, we will have to ask
all the Neighbors to drain their Corn Liquor from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_329">[Pg 329]</span>
their stills in there for a couple of days. Then
we could float the Leviathan.</p>

<p>Of course I don’t get anything done for my Harbor
because my River really <i>exists</i>.</p>

<p>Now, Folks, why patronise California-made Productions?
The Capitol Comedy Co. of Washington,
D. C., have never had a failure. They are every
one, 100 percent funny, or 100 percent Sad.</p>

<p>They are making some changes in their cast down
there and later I will tell you about that. Also
something about the Director.</p>

<p>So long, Folks, I will meet you at the Naval
Manœuvers on CONTENTNEA CREEK next
year.</p>

GOOD</h2>
</div>


<p>Out of the west came a little skinny runt
kid, born out in the hills of South Dakota.
On Sundays the Cowpunchers and
Ranchers would meet and have Cow Pony races.
On account of his being small he was lifted up and a
surcingle was strapped around over his legs and
around the horse. He was taken to the starting line
on a straightaway and was “lapped and tapped” off.
He had the nerve and he seemed to have the head.
So they cut the surcingle and he got so he could sit
up there on one of those postage stamp things they
call a Jockey’s saddle. He kept riding around these
little Country Shooting Gallery meets, and Merry-Go-Round
Gatherings, until he finally got good
enough to go to a real race track at New Orleans.
There he saw more Horses in one race than he had
ever seen at one track before.</p>

<p>His first race he ran 2nd. Then he said to himself,
“Why run second? Why not run first?” And
he did. They began to notice that this kid really<span class="pagenum" id="Page_334">[Pg 334]</span>
<i>savied</i> a Horse. He spoke their language. Horses
seemed to know when the kid was up. He carried
a Bat (Jockey’s term for a whip) but he never
seemed to use it. Other Jocks would come down the
stretch whipping a Horse out when the best he could
finish would be 4th or 5th. But not this kid. When
he couldn’t get in the money he never punished them.
He hand rode them. He could get more out of
a Horse with his hands than another Jock could get
with the old Battery up both sleeves.</p>

<p>He got to be recognized as one of the best, and
he passed from one Stable to another until he landed
with the biggest, a real Trainer and a Real Sportsman-Owner.
How many thousands of People in
every line come to New York every year that want
to make good, get ahead and be recognized! They
come by the millions. How many, if anything happened
to them, would get even a passing Notice in
the busy and overcrowded New York Press. If
some Millionaire died, the best he could get would
be a column. Then perhaps it wouldn’t be read
through by a dozen. But what blazoned across the
front pages of every Metropolitan daily a few days
ago, in bigger headlines than a Presidential Nomination,
bigger than the Prince of Wales will get on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_335">[Pg 335]</span>
his arrival? In a race at Saratoga Springs, N. Y.,
a Horse had fallen and carried down with him a
little skinny Kid (that had slept in his youth not
in a 5th Avenue Mansion but in Box Stalls all over
the Country with Horses, the Horses he knew how
to ride and the Horses that loved to run their best
for him).</p>

<p>Here was the Headline: “SANDE IS HURT.
He may never ride again.” They don’t have to
give even his first name; few know it. They don’t
have to explain who he is. They don’t have to tell
which Rockefeller or Morgan it was. It was just
Sande. There is only one. Our Sande! The boy
who had carried America’s colors to Victory over
England’s great Papyrus and their Premier Jockey
Steve Donohue.</p>

<p>The Ambulance rushes on the track and picks him
up; it is followed by hundreds afoot, running. The
entire grand stands of people rush to the temporary
Track Hospital to see how Sande is, and hoping and
praying that it’s not serious. He revives long
enough to tell his Wife he is all right. Game kid
that. Then he faints again. Mrs. Vanderbilt and
the elite of Society are assisting and doing all they
can to help. A personal Physician to a President<span class="pagenum" id="Page_336">[Pg 336]</span>
of the United States is working over him. He could
not have shown any more anxiety over the President
than he did over this kid. When the thousands
of pleasure seekers and excitement hunters rushed
from the stands and saw them lifting that frail lifeless
looking form from the track Ambulance there
was not one that wouldn’t have given an Arm off
their body if they had thought it would save his
Life, and that goes for Touts, and Grooms, and
Swipes, as well as the Public.</p>

<p>Some western people who don’t know are always
saying Easterners have no Heart, everything is for
themselves and the Dough. Say, don’t tell me that!
Geography don’t change Human Nature. If you
are Right, people are for you whether it’s in Africa
or Siberia. A wire was sent by Mr. Widener, a
millionaire Racing Official, to Dr. Russell the great
Specialist of Roosevelt Hospital, New York, “Come
at once. Spare no expense. SANDE is Hurt!”
That’s all Secretary Slemp could do if President
Coolidge was hurt.</p>

<p>Mr. Sinclair withdrew all Horses from the remaining
Races. He would withdraw them for Life
if he knew it would restore this Kid who worked for
him, back to normal again.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_337">[Pg 337]</span></p>

<p>Now what made this One Hundred and Ten
Pounds (half portion of physical manhood) beloved
by not only the racing Public but by the masses
who never bet a cent on a Horse race in their lives?
The same thing that will make a man great in any
line—his absolute HONESTY. The racing public
are very fickle and when they lose they are apt to
lay blame on almost any quarter. But win or lose,
they knew it was not Sande. To have insinuated to
one of them that he ever pulled a Horse, would have
been taking your Life in your hands. What do you
suppose he could have gotten out of some bunch of
betting Crooks to have pulled Zev in the big International
Race? Why, enough to retire on and never
have to take another chance with his Life by riding.
He could have done it on the back stretch and no one
would have ever known.</p>

<p>Ability is all right but if it is not backed up by
Honesty and Public confidence you will never be a
Sande. A man that don’t love a Horse, there is
something the matter with him. If he has no sympathy
for the man that does love Horses then there
is something worse the matter with him. The best
a Man can do is to arrive at the top of his chosen
profession. I have always maintained that one Profession<span class="pagenum" id="Page_338">[Pg 338]</span>
is deserving of as much honor as another
provided it is honorable.</p>

<p>Through some unknown process of reasoning we
have certain things that are called Arts, and to be
connected with them raises you above your fellow
Man. Say, how do they get that way? If a Man
happens to take up Painting and becomes only a
mediocre painter, why should he be classed above
the Bricklayer who has excelled every other Bricklayer?
The Bricklayer is a true Artist in his line
or he could not have reached the top. The Painter
has not been acclaimed the best in his line hence the
Bricklayer is superior. Competition is just as keen
in either line. In fact there are more good bricklayers
than Painters. If you are the best Taxi
Driver you are as much an Artist as Kreisler. You
save lives by your skilful driving. That’s a meritorious
profession, is it not?</p>

<p>A Writer calls himself a Literary Man or an
Artist. There are thousands of them, and all,
simply because they write, are termed Artists. Is
there a Sande among them? Caruso was great, but
he had only to show ability. He didn’t have to
demonstrate any honesty. Nobody tried to keep
him from singing his best by bribery.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_339">[Pg 339]</span></p>

<p>Now if you think the Racing Public and millions
of well wishers are hoping for this Kid’s recovery,
what about the Horses? They knew him better than
the Humans did. Why, that Horse would have
broke his own neck rather than hurt Sande. Who
is going to ride him in the next race and make him
win and not whip him?—not Sande. Who is going
to sit on him just where he will be the easiest to
carry? Not Sande. Who is going to lean over and
whisper in his ear and tell him when to go his best?
Not Sande. Who is going to carry a Bat and not
use it? Not Sande. Who is going to watch the
hand on that starting Barrier and have him headed
the right way just when the starter springs it? Not
Sande. No, the Horses are the ones who are going
to miss him.</p>

<p>If we could speak their language like he can, here
are a few conversations that you will hear through
the cracks in the Box Stalls: “Gee, I can’t run; I
don’t seem to get any help. I wish Sande were
back.”</p>

<p>A three year old replies, “I wish there was something
we could do. If they would just let us go up
to the Hospital and talk to him he would savy,” “I
wish we had him here in a Box Stall. I would stand<span class="pagenum" id="Page_340">[Pg 340]</span>
up the rest of my life and give him my bed. I would
fix him some Clean Hay to lay on. He don’t want
those White Caps and Aprons running around. He
wants to lay on a Horse Blanket, and have his busted
Leg wrapped up with Bandages like he knows how to
use on ours. I bet they ain’t even got Absorbine up
there. That Kid would rather have a Bran Mash
than all that Goo they will feed him with up there.”</p>

<p>The Old Stake Horse 4 stalls down the line overhears
and replies: “Sure, I bet they have one of
them Bone Specialists. What that Kid needs is a
good Vet.”</p>

<p>The old Selling Plater butts in: “Sure, we could
cheer him up if he was here. Them Foreigners up
there don’t speak his Tongue. That kid is part
Horse. Remember how he used to kid wid us when
he would be working us out at daylight when the
rest of the Star Jocks was in feathers. One morning
I told him if he didn’t quit waking me up so
early in the morning I was going to buck him off.
He got right back at me; he said, ‘If you do I will
get you left at the Post your next race.’ Gee, he
sure did throw a scare into me. And, say, you
couldn’t loaf on that Bird either. He knew when
you was loafing and when you was trying. I throwed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_341">[Pg 341]</span>
up my tail one hot day to make him think I was all
through. He give me one cut with the Bat and I
dropped that tail and left there so fast I could have
run over Man of War. Gee, those were great days;
Do youse reckon Zev knows anything about it? I
hope they don’t tell him; it would break his heart.
He sure did love that kid.”</p>

<p>Patient readers, Lincoln went down in History as
“HONEST Abe,” BUT HE NEVER WAS A

gone down as just “Abe.”</p>

<p>Now, in my more or less checkered career
before the more or less checkered Public,
I have been asked to publicly indorse
everything from Chewing Gum, Face Beautifiers,
Patent Cocktail Shakers, Ma Junk Sets, even
Corsets, Cigarettes, and Chewing Tobacco, all of
which I didn’t use or know anything about. But I
always refused.</p>

<p>You never heard me boosting for anything, for I
never saw anything made that the fellow across the
street didn’t make something just as good.</p>

<p>But, at last, I have found something that I absolutely
know no one else has something just as
good as, for an all-seeing Nature put this where
it is and it’s the only one he had, and by a coincidence
it is located in the Town near the ranch where I
was born and raised.</p>

<p>So I hereby and hereon come out unequivocally
(I think that’s the way you spell it) in favor of a
place that has the water that I <i>know</i> will cure you.
You might ask, cure me of what? Why, cure you<span class="pagenum" id="Page_346">[Pg 346]</span>
of anything—just name your disease and dive in.</p>

<p>Claremore, Oklahoma, is the birthplace of this
Aladdin of health waters. Some misguided Soul
named it RADIUM WATER, but Radium will
never see the day that it is worth mentioning in
the same breath as this Magic Water. Why, to the
afflicted and to all suffering Humanity, a Jug of
this Water is worth a wheelbarrow full of Radium.
Still, even under the handicap of a cheap name, this
liquid Godsend has really cured thousands.</p>

<p>Now you may say, “Oh you boost it because you
live there,” but I don’t want you to think so little
of me that you would think I would misguide a sick
person, just for the monetary gain to my Home
Town. We don’t need you that bad. The city is
on a self supporting basis without Patients, just by
shipping the Water to Hot Springs, Ark., Hot
Springs, Va., West Baden, Ind., and Saratoga, N. Y.</p>

<p>Now, as to a few of the Ignorant who might still
be in the dark as to where the Home of this Fountain
of Youth is located, I will tell you. I shouldn’t
waste my time on such Low Brows, but unfortunately
they get sick and need assistance the same as the
95 Million others who already know where Claremore
is located.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_347">[Pg 347]</span></p>

<p>It is located, this Mecca of the ill, about 17
hundred miles west of New York, (either City or
State, depends on which ever one you happen to
be in). You bear a little south of west, after leaving
New York, till you reach Sol McClellan’s place,
which is just on the outskirts of Claremore. Before
you get into the City proper, if you remember about
500 miles back, you passed another Town. Well,
that was St. Louis, most of which is in Illinois.</p>

<p>Now, if you are in the North, and happen to get
something the matter with you, we are 847 and a
half miles South by West from Gary, Indiana. We
have cured hundreds of people from Chicago, Ill.
from Gun shot wounds inflicted in attempted murders
and robberies. There is only one way to avoid
being robbed of anything in Chicago and that is
not to have anything.</p>

<p>If you are from Minneapolis, our Radium Water
guarantees to cure you of everything but your
Swedish accent. If you are from St. Paul, we can
cure you of everything but your ingrown hatred for
Minneapolis.</p>

<p>I will admit that these waters have quite a peculiar
odor as they have a proportion of Sulphur
and other unknown ingredients, but visitors from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_348">[Pg 348]</span>
Kansas City, who are used to a Stock Yard breeze,
take this wonderful water home as a Perfume.</p>

<p>Approaching this City from the North, don’t get
it confused with Oolagah, Oklahoma, my original
Birthplace, which is 12 miles to the north, as both
towns have Post Offices.</p>

<p>From the west, if you are afflicted and you are
sure to be or you wouldn’t have gone out there,
why Claremore is just 1900 miles due east of Mojarve,
California, one of the few Towns which Los
Angeles has not voted into their Cafeteria. You
come east till you reach an Oil Station at a road
crossing. This oil station is run by a man named
St. Clair. You will see a lot of men pitching Horseshoes.
Well, that is the Post Office of Tulsa, Oklahoma,
and the men are Millionaires pitching Horseshoes
for Oil Wells or for each other’s wives.</p>

<p>You should, by this description, have the place
pretty well located in your minds. Now, if you are
living in the South and are afflicted with a Cotton
Crop under a Republican Administration, or with
the Klu Klux, or with the Hook Worm, we guarantee
to rid you of either or all of these in a course of
24 Baths.</p>

<p>Claremore is located just 905 miles north of Senator<span class="pagenum" id="Page_349">[Pg 349]</span>
Pat Harrison’s Mint Bed in Mississippi. In
coming from the Gulf Country some have got off
the road and had to pass through Dallas, Texas,
but have found out their mistake and got back on
the main road at Ft. Worth before losing all they
had. You easily can tell Ft. Worth. A fellow will
be standing down in front of the Drug Store making
a speech.</p>

<p>Now, before reaching Claremore, you will pass,
even though it’s in the middle of the day, a place
where you think it’s night and you won’t know what
is the matter. Well, that’s Muskogee, Oklahoma,
and this darkness is caused by the Color scheme of
the population, so put on your headlights and go
on in. This Muskogee is really a parking space for
cars entering Claremore. Of course, if you want
to drive on into the Town of Claremore proper, its
only 60 miles through the suburbs from here.</p>

<p>The City is located on Cat Creek, and instead
of having a lot of Streets like most Towns and
Cities, we have combined on one street. In that way
no Street is overlooked.</p>

<p>You might wonder how we discovered this Blarney
Stone of Waters. In the early days, us old
timers there, always considered these Wells more as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_350">[Pg 350]</span>
an Odor than as a Cure. But one day a man come
in there who had been raised in Kansas and he
had heard in a roundabout way of people bathing,
although he had never taken one. So, by mistake,
he got into this Radium Water.</p>

<p>He was a one armed man—he had lost an Arm in
a rush to get into a Chautauqua Tent in Kansas to
hear Bryan speak on Man Vs. Monkey. Well he
tried this Bath and it didn’t kill him and he noticed
that he was beginning to sprout a new arm where
he had lost the old one, so he kept on with the
Baths and it’s to him that we owe the discovery of
this wonderful curative Water. Also he was the
Pioneer of Bathers of Kansas, as now they tell me
it’s no uncommon thing to have a Tub in most of
their larger towns.</p>

<p>Now, it has been discovered that you can carry
a thing too far and overdo it, so we don’t want
you there too long. A man come there once entirely
Legless and stayed a week too long and went away
a Centipede.</p>

<p>I want to offer here my personal Testimonial of
what it did to me. You see, after this Kansas Guy
started it, why, us old Timers moved our bathing
from the River into a Tub. Now, at that time, I was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_351">[Pg 351]</span>
practically Tongue tied and couldn’t speak out in
private much less in Public. Well, after 12 baths,
I was able to go to New York and make after
dinner speeches. I stopped in Washington on the
way and saw how our Government was run and
that gave me something funny to speak about.</p>

<p>So, in thanking the Water, I also want to thank
the Government for making the whole thing possible.
Now, had I taken 24 baths I would have been
a Politician, so you see I stopped just in time.</p>

<p>The only thing I get out of this is I have the
“Thrown Away Crutch Privilege.” If you don’t
get well and throw away your Invalid Chair or
crutches I get nothing out of it, so that is why we
give you a square deal. If you are not cured, I
don’t get your Crutches. There is no other resort
in the World that works on that small a margin.</p>

<p>W. J. Bryan drank one drink of this Water and
turned against Liquor. Senator La Follette drank
two drinks of it and turned against everything. So
remember Claremore, The Carlsbad of America,
where the ’Frisco Railroad crosses the Iron Mountain
Railroad, not often, but every few days.</p>
